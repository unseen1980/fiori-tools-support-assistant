Product Area selected: SAP Fiori front-end server Product Function selected: SAP Fiori front-end server  > Activation & Configuration Component selected (Product Function Selection): CA-FE-CFG --- Description --- Hi Team, We are migrating our Fiori apps to BAS. We started with 2 applications and connected them to cloud foundry Project Dev system (F1D). We successfully deployed them and created launchpad sites and were able to access the apps. However now we want to connect the same apps to Sustain Dev system (F2D) as we are planning to move ahead from our Sustain rail, but we are facing certain challenges as the existing apps keep pointing to F1D system. Can you please help us with the correct approach of cross system deployment of Fiori apps from BAS. Thanks,

customer has followed the steps above to build and deploy his apps using BAS
Customer has created a multitarget container, app router configuration and then created 2 Fiori applications under the container. Then he has deployed the applications to Cloud Foundry where 2 development systems are configured (devfgw1 and devfgw2 which are similar to on-premise systems f1d and f2d respectively). oData services are also configured in devfgw1 and devfgw2. Started apps creation and connection with devfgw1, deployed to cloud foundry and then integrated to site directory as well. However, now the customer wants to deploy the apps to devfgw2. There is no transport movement between devfgw1 and devfgw2, as these are development systems of 2 different rails (Project and Sustain). In case of Eclipse, an app can be undocked from a system and then docked  to another system. Then the app can be submitted.
However, in case of BAS when creating the apps, they are connected to system devfgw1 and the target selected as Cloud Foundry. So the apps now keep pointing to devfgw1 as the system details are fed into 15 auto generated files of each app project. What is the correct approach to make the existing apps pointing to devfgw2? The only other 2 options that the customer could come up with are - * to recreate all the steps again for devfgw2 which included lot of manual activities * to modify all those standard files which have system specific details and replace devfgw1 with devfgw2 and build and deploy again --Research (internal)-- KBA 3137641 component CA-UX-IDE 2022-04-19 12:25:53 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
Please let me know if there are any other questions?

Hi , Thank you so much. We will go through all the shared links and try implementing them. Thanks & Regards,  2022-04-04 15:34:09 -  (I313149) (External Info)

Hi,
I've documented some notes around your first and second question; please beware, these are suggested solutions only. These are high level approaches to give you an understanding of how you might approach your issue around deploying to different environments.Again, if you require more specific, workable approaches based on your current configuration, then I can initiate a conversation with our consultancy team who can work with you to generate a working solution.To answer question 1 and 2 you need to understand managed approuter applications configurations;
https://blogs.sap.com/2020/10/02/serverless-sap-fiori-apps-in-sap-cloud-platform/
These mta applications can support instance based and subaccount destinations and there is a distinction;
Subaccount destinations are available to all applications hosted on each of your subaccounts and your subaccount spaces i.e. dev | quality
Typical creation of a subaccount destination https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/cp-cf-create-destination.html
Instance based destinations are managed differently, https://help.sap.com/viewer/cca91383641e40ffbe03bdc78f00f681/Cloud/en-US/7e306250e08340f89d6c103e28840f30.html and are normally created via an mta.yaml as shown here https://github.com/SAP-samples/fiori-tools-samples/blob/3e7787764635f7454cc3b479af014926c91276e4/cap/cap-fiori-mta/mta.yaml#L42 https://github.com/SAP-samples/fiori-tools-samples/blob/3e7787764635f7454cc3b479af014926c91276e4/cap/cap-fiori-mta/mta.yaml#L95
These destinations are created using a destination service which is bound to an mta. For a deeper dive, please refer to this 3 part tutorial that will give you a better understanding of instance based destinations;
To answer your specific questions, your questions are based on the following assumption that your application is using a managed approuter configuration and your application code is in source control.
One approach is to reuse a destination service across different indepdent mta's i.e. you configure the destination service once and re-use it in your respective mta applications https://blogs.sap.com/2022/01/14/designing-ui5-apps-for-sap-launchpad-service-part-1/ - please read the three parts to get a full understanding of this approach
Another approach is a CI/CD pipeline, Please beware that SAP provides a CI/CD framework that might suit your needs, please refer to this question https://answers.sap.com/questions/13240867/how-to-transport-the-application-deployed-in-one-s.html.
If you are to deploy across different subaccounts, then I would be suggesting using instance based destinations in your mta.yaml configuration. For example, using the CI/CD approach you could have a different destination loaded per environment i.e.
_schema-version: "3.2"ID: cf-destinations-sample version: 0.0.1 resources: - name: cf-destination-service type: org.cloudfoundry.managed-service parameters: service: destination service-name: cf-destination-service service-plan: lite path: ./destinations.json
And the destinations.json would contain specific settings reflecting the different environment;
{ "HTML5Runtime_enabled": true, "version": "1.0.0", "init_data": { "instance": { "existing_destinations_policy": "update", "destinations": [ { "Name": "ui5", "Description": "UI5", "Authentication": "NoAuthentication", "ProxyType": "Internet", "Type": "HTTP", "URL": "https://ui5.sap.com", "HTML5.DynamicDestination": true } ] } } }
where the `destinations.json` file loaded can differ from subaccount. So in theory, you would have a destination-dev.json and a destinations-quality.json file. When your application is being built and deployed, your CI/CD pipeline scripts would use the appropriate destination file to load the correct destinations. This is the recommended approach over using subaccount destinations, since it removes the requirement to have to configure subaccount destinations on each environment.
If you understand how destinations are created and managed, then the answer to your 2nd question is to expose the following; Option 1. two subaccount destinations Option 2. or two instance based destination using an mta.yaml
Your Fiori application will require a change to your xs-app.json, for example; { "welcomeFile": "/index.html", "authenticationMethod": "route", "routes": [ { "source": "^/your-datasource1/(.*)$", "target": "/your-datasource1/$1", "destination": "devfgw1", "authenticationType": "xsuaa", "csrfProtection": false }, { "source": "^/your-datasource2/(.*)$", "target": "/your-datasource2/$1", "destination": "devfgw2", "authenticationType": "xsuaa", "csrfProtection": false }, { "source": "^/resources/(.*)$", "target": "/resources/$1", "authenticationType": "none", "destination": "ui5" }, { "source": "^/test-resources/(.*)$", "target": "/test-resources/$1", "authenticationType": "none", "destination": "ui5" }, { "source": "^(.*)$", "target": "$1", "service": "html5-apps-repo-rt", "authenticationType": "xsuaa" } ] }
You would need to then add/edit your manifest to support a second datasource, please refer to https://answers.sap.com/questions/13219417/how-do-i-add-a-second-odata-service-in-business-ap.html or https://blogs.sap.com/2021/05/25/adding-multiple-odata-services-and-syncing-the-metadata-and-annotation-file-using-service-manager-in-visual-studio-code./ where you are adding a service using Fiori Tools Service Modeler.
I hope these notes provide some explaination of how to approach some of your existing issues.

Hi,
I've tried on different systems both on windows/mac and linux (BAS) and the tar seems to be corrupt.
It would be great if you generate a zip using the zip command previosuly posted as this will exclude the node_mod folders and any other archives that take up huge space.
If you have any issues with the zip command, please refer to

Hi,
Thank you for the attachment, however, I'm getting issues when untar'ing it on to a test system. Would you be able to run the following command;
zip -r feproject.zip -x */\.* *.git* \.* *.zip *.env* *.mta *.rb *.bak *.swp *.DS_Store *.back *.merge *.txt *.sh **/resources/\* **/gen/\* **/node_modules/\* **/mta_archives/\* **/dist/\* **/.ABAPDeployResources/\* **/.vscode/\*
where is replaced with the directory path of your project. Open a new terminal window, change into the root of your project, run `pwd` which will output the project folder path. You can use this path in the zip command above, replaceing with the value.
This will produce a smaller zip that is more managable and I can install the specific node versions based on your package-lock.json.
I will try to provide some answsers to question 1 and 2 over the coming days. I will need to review your application and destinations. If my answers dont provide enough information or you require more details that is outside the scope of Fiori Tools, we have a consultancy team who can work with you to provide a working solution.

Hi Team, We are trying to migrate our Fiori applications to BAS from Eclipse. We followed the steps from below link. https://developers.sap.com/group.launchpad-cf-add-custom-app.html So we created a multitarget container, app router configuration and then created 2 Fiori applications under the container. We then deployed the applications to Cloud Foundry where we have configured 2 development systems (devfgw1 and devfgw2 which are similar to our on-premise systems f1d and f2d respectively). We also have our oData services configured in devfgw1 and devfgw2. We started our apps creation and connection with devfgw1 and were able to deploy to cloud foundry and then integrate to site directory as well. However, now we want to deploy the apps to devfgw2. For us there is no transport movement between devfgw1 and devfgw2, as these are development systems of 2 different rails (Project and Sustain). In case of eclipse, we can just undock an app from a system and then dock it to another system and just submit the app. However, in case of BAS when we had created apps, we had them connect to system devfgw1 and the target selected as Cloud Foundry. So the apps now keep pointing to devfgw1 as the system details are fed into 15 auto generated files of each app project.

Dear customer,
This issue will require a fix from our side. The current implement keeps asking to retry password when ATO setting service failed. Instead it should skip this step and continue the deploy config generation process if ATO setting service is missing.
There is a workaround for now if you need this urgently. Your current setting uses Authentication Type "NoAuthentication" in your SAP Cloud destination configuration. Thus you need to provide username/password during deploy config generation. If you temporarily change the destination configuration to "BasicAuthentication" and store the username/password on the destination configuration. This will skip the authentication step for this destination during deploy configuration. In this case, missing ATO setting will be handled and won't block the rest of the deploy config steps.
2022-06-09 15:49:12 -  (I830561) (Internal Info)
This requires a fix from our side. Missing ATO setting service should not block the execution of deploy config generation. But in this scenario, we fixed handling of authentication and missing ATO settings: we consider 404 error as unsuccessful authentication and keep asking user to retry the password. Thus, the process cannot be continued. To fix this issue, we need to keep retry password only for 401 errors, other errors for querying ATO setting service should not break the process but just log a warning message. 2022-06-09 11:23:09 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi , as mentioned several (!) times in this incident, we using SAP_BASIS 7.40 (= SAP ERP 6.0 EhP 7) for our core dev system and ATO service (Key User In ) is not available there.

Hello , Query /sap/bc/adt/ato/settings is needed to fetch the default dev package, required package prefix letter, etc from backend for input validation and filling default package name.
Let's check the backend. Depending on your on-prem server is http or https, please use the appropriate url: http:// : /sap/bc/adt/ato/settings?sap-client= https:// : /sap/bc/adt/ato/settings?sap-client=YourOnPremHostSapClientNumber> You only need to put the url in a browser window on a computer that have access to your on-premise system. After putting the url in a browser, you should be asked for your on-prem user credential. If the query is successful, an XML response is returned. The xml content might be shown in the browser page, or it might be a file called "settings" downloaded by your browser. 2. Let's check if the destination is accessible and usable from your Business Application Studio. Please check if the services you need are reachable.
Please open the terminal and type the following:
1. export AXIOS_LOG=true
2. yo @sap/fiori
Run through the prompts until the auth error is seen and copy the output trace. I would like you also to make a request with curl in order to verify connectivity: Please type this to get the list of V2 services (replace user/password/destination_name): curl -u : "$H2O_URL/destinations/ /sap/opu/odata/IWFND/CATALOGSERVICE;v=2/ServiceCollection?%24top=1"
Please type this to get the list of V4 services (replace user/password/destination_name):

Dear Colleagues,
The customer has issue with a project migrated from Web IDE to BAS. The issue is with adding deploy config to the project.

The customer asks whether BAS is using the service  /sap/bc/adt/ato/.

I have found this document https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/sdk/#/topic/91f3ecc06f4d1014b6dd926db0e91070 which states that only the Web IDE is using this service but our development team is not sure that BAS is not using.
Could you please check it and tell to the customer whether the service is used by BAS or not when trying to deploy to ABAP? If it is used the documentation has to be fixed as well.

Thank you and best regards,  2022-06-01 08:32:12 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi , in the doc you provided that /sap/bc/adt/ato/* is only required for deployment from SAP WebIDE and not from BAS. As our backend DEV system actually does not have that ato service (SAP_BASIS 7.40.0023), can you verify that requirement for BAS, please?

Hi ,

The infrastructure issues have been resolved.  Can you please try and undeploy and redeploy again?  If this doesn't work, please provide details of the errors being returned for us to investigate. We can set up a call if needed after that.

2022-10-20 08:15:35 -  (I305274) (External Info)
Hi ,

If you are unable to use /UI5/UI5_REPOSITORY_LOAD, unfortunately Fiori tools team cannot support until the infrastructure issues causing the error 500 are resolved by our infrastructure colleagues.  This is under investigation.

I'll keep this case assigned to me, and as soon as the infrastructure issues are resolved I will revert back to you.

Hello , I have tried multiple times, I am facing error (Request failed with status code 500). I have tested destination connection it is 200 success. Let me know your availability to have a working session to close this issue.

 2022-10-19 14:30:29 -  (I305274) (External Info)
Hi ,

Ok.  So there are 2 issues you are seeing :(.  First is that you can't redeploy an existing application.  This, as I mentioned, will be fixed in an upcoming release.  In order to work around this, you have an option to undeploy and redeploy (or use UI5_REPOSITORY_LOAD).

The second issue is related to our cloud connector, and customers are seeing intermitent 500 errors when deploying or undeploying or retrieving data from their destination.   This is under investigation from another team.

Therefore, can you try and undeploy again?  It should succeed if not the first time, then the second time you try.  If that works, then try and deploy the application again.

Please let me know if this helps?
Regards,

2022-10-19 13:34:40 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)

Hi,

Please provide some details on what happens when you attempt to upload with /UI5/UI5_REPOSITORY_LOAD?  Can you provide some screenshots of the error?  This is a valid work around until we add this feature in an upcoming release.  Some details on how to use this report: https://pravin517.wordpress.com/2018/02/06/deploy-a-ui5-application-to-as-abap-using-report-ui5-ui5_repository_load/

If you are unable to use this, there is another option, you can first undeploy the existing application and then re-deploy again.  Please do the following:

In the root of your Fiori project, execute: npm run undeploy
This should undeploy the existing application.  You can then run:
npm run deploy

to deploy it again.

Also, please refer to note https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/67739 regarding priority of issues. I'm reducing the priority of the issue from very high to high.

Hello Customer,

Sorry to hear that you are experiencing this issue.  We had recently identified this as a bug in our deployment logic and are in the process of fixing it in our code.

In the meantime, could you please upload the application via /UI5/UI5_REPOSITORY_LOAD?  This will allow you to redeploy an existing application.

But thanks for your patience, as I say, we are actively looking to fix this deploy issue in our code currently.

Product Area selected: SAP Fiori front-end server Component selected (Manual Selection): CA-UX-IDE --- Description --- Hello, We are experiencing issues trying tu use Fiori-tools generator : First the generator is unable to reach our local oData service and is always giving a forbidden access response from the proxy, which is strange because our proxy is configured to bypass these hostnames. If I try in chrome, the service is reached with no problem. If I disable VSCode proxy, I am able to reach the oData service and to continue. But then, at the time of generation, I get another network error when the generator try to reach "https://registry.npmjs.org/@sap%2fux-specification". Again 403 error form the proxy. But again, if I try in chrome I have no problem reaching the url. The result is the same, whether I turn the VScode proxy on or off. To check if the problem comes from our proxy, I tried to generate a fiori app at home with no vpn, no proxy, with Northwind Odata test service. The service is reached, but at the time of generation i have the same error to connect to npmjs.org. Thanks for your help   -I use Eclipse with ADT and  local edition with the same -The version of generator we use : 1.1.3 -The error message when generating is attached

Hello , Adding direct IP in the hosts file results in nothing working anymore in VSCode. Commands for git, or fiori generators are unknown. I use node 12.16.1 and npm 6.13.4 Thanks for helping  2021-04-12 13:37:27 -  (C5293748) (External Info)
Hi , could you please try one possible temporary workaround. Please execute command  registry.npmjs.org to get the ip address of the repo server. And then add a line x.x.x.x registry.npmjs.org to /etc/hosts file where x.x.x.x is the ip returned by  command. Then try to generate app again. Lets check if it helps you. Could you please provide versions of node and npm installed in your system. Regards,  2021-04-07 09:36:26 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi , There is may be something to be done in the Proxy but : * Generating app from home with no proxy / no VPN gives me the same error (see Attachment) * Reaching internal service and generating app is working fine with the proxy using  or ui5 tooling. There is probably a difference in the way the connection is made. I downloaded the 1.1.7 file but when installing I get the same error with proxy when trying to reach https://registry.npmjs.org/@sap%2fcds Thanks for your help  2021-04-02 09:15:22 -  (I335123) (External Info)
Hi , The proxy configuration seems to not be correct and that's why you get a 403. The reason you are probably still able to install the ui5/cli package is because your system has it in the global npm cache and it installs it from there. One thing you can try in the meantime is from your browser download the generator from this url https://registry.npmjs.org/@sap/generator-fiori/-/generator-fiori-1.1.7.tgz and then use the command npm install -g Regards  2021-04-01 15:12:51 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi , Thank for your answer. My proxy is set. I'm not very familiar with node.js but here is a strange behaviour I see : Trying to update  generator with "npm.cmd install -g generator-app-fiori@latest" is resulting in a 403 error on the url "https://registry.npmjs.org/generator-app-fiori". This url is working fine in chrome. If I call "npm install --global @ui5/cli" to install ui5 tooling cli, I also get the 403 error. But if I call "npm install" in a folder where I have a package.json file with devDependencies @ui5/cli, then I works and the package is installed. In the end I use "https://sap.github.io/ui5-tooling/" to develop and it is working fine, but I would prefer to use SAP Fiori Tools extension. Have a nice day,  2021-03-26 14:55:35 -  (I305274) (External Info)
Hi , Thanks for reaching out.  It looks like NPM is not correctly configured for use with your corporate proxy.  Can you please try the following from the command line: npm config get proxy and npm config get https-proxy If they are not returning the details of your Corporate proxy, then you will need to set them as follows (replacing the parameters below with your proxy details): npm config set proxy http:// @proxy-server-url>: and npm config set https-proxy http:// @proxy-server-url>: And then restart VSCode. Please see https://medium.com/@ogbemudiatimothy/using-npm-install-behind-a-corporate-proxy-server-db150c128899 for an example on how to do this. Thank you,

Hello ,
you've entered the wrong configuration. Based on you screenshot you've copied the "fiori-tools-proxy" configuration from the "ui5.yaml" into the "ui5-deploy.yaml". This is not what I said.
All you need to do is to just add the single property "ignoreCertError: true" to the "ui5-deploy.yaml". And it must look exactly as in the screenshot that I attached.
Best regards,

The Fiori tools team 2023-01-18 14:01:26 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi , We have added the config as suggested but it is still throwing the same error. Please suggest. Thanks,  2023-01-18 13:05:54 -  (D062812) (External Info)
Dear Customer,
I believe that the deployment issue comes from a missing configuration in the ui5-deploy.yaml.
Please add the flag "ignoreCertError: true" to the "ui5-deploy.yaml" and try to deploy again.
Please see screenshot for reference.
Best regards,

The Fiori tools team 2023-01-18 11:29:51 -  (D062812) (External Info)
Dear customer,
thank you for the call today. To summarize:
We we able to manage the connection to the backend system by setting the "
NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0"
We've validated that either VPN nor Proxy configuration is needed We've validated that generating and preview an application is working
What is currently not working is the deployment of the application. When trying to deploy an error about a self-signed certificate is thrown.
We will investigate the issue about deployment and will get back to you as soon as possible

Hi Colleagues

Issue:
we would like to extend the Application: pis4.idea.plm.documentmanagement from our S4/HANA (H20) SAP System. For this we use the template Adaptation Project in BAS and the Guided Development function. Unfortunately the option '' is not active. See attachment. What do we have to do to activate this function?

It is unclear who is supporting Guided Development functionality in BAS. Is it related to fiori tools?
Customer issue is that there are a lot of menu items with warning signs in their project which they are using Guided Development with. There's certain functions not available. See the attached video.
The application team in CA-DMS state:
The issue is not specific to any app. There is a warning symbol in the menu items and some items are not selectable in the Guided development page. Kindly check the video attached and address accordingly.

Hi Team,
THe customer in OP2020 and as per the call with customer i understood the below.
The customer is trying to extend the Manage Document application in Business Application studio , by creating Adaptation Project by providing our reference to Manage documents app. After this steps they opened the guided development option and in that Guided development is not able to find what pages are available in the new project, hence the insert code snippet option not enabled when customer is trying to add custom action or any thing like that.
This issue is not only with Manage Documents APP, it seems very generic.
Am not able to figure out the right component , as it is OP ticket am routing to you, please forward the ticket to right component.

Please check your configuration or use npm/yarn to install it globally Yeoman is not installed or available in your executable path.

Do we still actually expect Yeoman to be installed in v1.8.3 of the Extension pack?  Wasn't this supposed to be done via the app generator?

Hi ,
Unfortunately you can't use the Application generator to add deploy config currently :(.  Certainly not in an easy way.  As I say, hopefully soon you will be able to add deploy-config via the wizard, we are working on that.  I think you probably have 2 options:

1.  globally (npm i -g yo) ,and then you should be able to successfully run deploy-config command from the command line.
2. You could alternatively try and create a new project with the Application generator, using the same data source as your current project.  If you include deploy config during generation, you should be able to copy the ui5-deploy.yaml file from your new project folder into the existing one.  You will also need to update the `package.json` file with the new deploy targets that were created.

Regards,

Hello , Thanks a lot for sharing that information.  That was very helpful.
Can you help me with one thing more.  Since the project is already built, is there a way to add a deploy-config via the application generator (wizard based) rather than via the yeoman based command line scripts? Regards,  2022-12-13 10:57:19 -  (I305274) (External Info)
Solution provided: Hello ,
Currently when using any of the configuration command line tools after generation, it requires the user to have Yeoman installed.  The Application Generator uses an extension called the Application Wizard, and this has a version of Yeoman built-in and therefore doesn't require Yeoman to be installed externally when it is used.
If using deploy-config command, Yeoman is directly utilised and expected to be installed.  Having said that, we are hopefully planning to shortly have the deploy-config task available as a UI in the Application Wizard, and not only a command line tool.  If that's delivered, then Yeoman will not be required for deploy-config.

I hope that answers your question.

Dear customer,
From the error logs you provided, I can only guess this warning might be related to the error: "warn lifecycle The node binary used for scripts is /extbin/bin/node but npm is using /opt/nodejs/node-v14.16.0-linux-x64/bin/node itself. Use the `--scripts-prepend-node-path` option to include the path for the node binary npm was executed with." It seems you have two versions of node.js on your computer. This might be the cause of the issue. Can you check if you can make sure a single node.js runtime is used for execution.

Dear Customer,

Note that the priority of your incident was adjusted, since based on your description, its original priority is not justified. SAP note #67739 explains the meaning of priorities, and SAP Note #19500 is for more information about reducing the priority of this incident.

Please use the correct priority according to the guideline from this note for future support tickets.

SAP defines priorities as follows:

Very high
A message with “very high” priority is justified when extremely serious interruptions in normal operations occur: Procedures which should not be interrupted cannot be executed, etc. This is caused by a full system crash or by interruptions in key functions in an SAP System in productive operation. The message requires immediate processing, as the breakdown could result in significant losses.

High
A message with “high” priority is justified when serious interruptions in normal operations occur, for instance, when important tasks cannot be performed.  This is caused when a function does not work or when a function is not available in the SAP system, and the function is urgently needed for dealing with the current situation. The message requires quick processing, as a lasting malfunction could cause serious interruptions to all work in the production system.

Medium
A message with a priority of “medium” is justified when interruptions in normal operations occur. This is caused when a function does not work or when a function is not available in the SAP system.

Low 
A message with a priority of “low” is justified when no or only minor interruptions in normal operations occur.  This is caused by a malfunctioning or unavailable function in the SAP system that is not required on a daily basis or not used regularly. Identical problem situations in test systems normally justify a priority that is one level lower than the equivalent priority in a production system.

The Fiori tools team 2022-09-13 16:05:12 -  (I313281) (External Info)
Dear Customer,

As the description of the issue is very vague, as "performance" in this case may be impacted by many factors and on any of the application components.

It may be the server (e.g. if another location in a different timezone starts using it), or it may be a backup software installed on users computers, scheduled to run daily at the same time.
It's impossible to say without more data.

Chrome dev-tools would allow you to reduce the number of options, i.e. at least see whether the performance drops on the client or server side.

It would also be useful to have some more metrics, like: 
- what's the usual loading time, vs the loading time when the performance is low?
- how many users experience that?
- does it happen every day at the same time or randomly?

Once that's clear, it should be possible for us to test and hopefully reproduce the issue.


Regards,
The Fiori tools team

HI , It’s perfectly make sense as for connecting from an APP that is deployed on CF (same subaccount) you need to make sure the connectivity URL of CF is open and when you try to connect from BAS you now need the BAS connectivity to be reachable as well to the on-prem system.

Dear Customer. The cloud connector fails to open a tunnel to the on-premise system and the "Tunnel handshake failed" error is displayed. Solution Some corporate proxies or network policies may block the cloud connector from connecting SAP Business Application Studio and the on-premise system. Make sure that you have an internet connection to the SAP Business Application Studio connectivity service host, to which you can connect your cloud connector.

Solution provided: Hi,
Thank you for confirm the issue is resolved.
Sorry again for this issue but we are in the process of making most of our modules open source. The mapping between the existing and new functionality wasnt correctly covered with unit tests.
 2022-09-14 07:26:52 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hello, I confirm that i am now calling the destinations correctly Regards,  2022-09-13 10:22:23 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
Can you confirm if you managed to get the destination working again?
Thanks.
 2022-09-12 13:39:48 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
I've just noticed there is a bug in the ui5-tooling.
I've spoken to the developers of the module and an open source component which is consumed as part of our module dependencies does not have the correct mapping for pathPrefix.
Can you please try the following;
- path: /B1i destination: O1_Support-B1iF url: https://www.google.com pathReplace: /
Using pathReplace instead? This should be backward compatible when the fix is released as well.
Sorry about the inconvenience.

2022-09-12 13:39:38 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
hi, I tried changing the fallback url, but it still worked, so it means that my destination is working, i also removed the full_url from the destination properties. It didn't change a thing. I tried to change the Path to something else, wich appeared in the B1iF logs, so the ui5.yaml is making a difference on the requests i'm making. So it's clear then, the pathPrefix option doesn't do anything and whatever i put in it, it still makes the request to the wrong URL. What's going on? Is this the intended behavior? and if not what am I doing wrong? Regards,  2022-09-12 13:18:05 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
Also, you have configured the destination as a full_url destination. This is not the case since its not only returning OData service but also providing other services.
I would remove the full_url from your destination properties.
With the removal of this property you could try then;

- path: /B1i
destination: O1_Support-B1iF
url: https://www.google.com
pathPrefix: /


2022-09-12 13:15:31 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
To 100% guarnate the destination is working as expected and is being used in your local preview instance, up the ui5.yaml for the backend B1i to the following;

- path: /B1i
destination: O1_Support-B1iF
url: https://www.google.com

if you are setting the API call in your backend, then you know the request is being routed through the destination instance.

Also try;

- path: /B1i
destination: O1_Support-B1iF
url: https://www.google.com
pathPrefix: /ServiceCalls

To determine this is working as well? Are there any additional headers required either from your app or in the destination properties to be passed to the backend host?



2022-09-12 12:19:55 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi, I can see, using the command you sent me, that the destination is working, as i get the right data. However, i can see in my B1if logs that the request isn't working, i get something like this: true POST /B1i/ServiceCalls With /B1i before my actual requested path (ServiceCalls),  can confirm is an error in the request url by making the same request in Postman /ServiceCalls works, /B1i/ServiceCalls doesn't and gives me the same error. If i understand correctly, my code is accessing my destination, but is adding the Path element of the destination to the request. When i add something in the pathPrefix, it should change what is before my requested url, right? And thus change the /B1i to /test in my case but changing pathPrefix doesn't change anything in my logs, so i'm lead to believe that it's not doing anything. I tried to update my node_modules, just in case, but still nothing. Regards,  2022-09-12 11:52:08 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
Just to confirm, you are able to access this URL via postman
https://vmsdevb1sql10-b1if.opti-one.fr/B1iXcellerator/exec/ipo/vP.0010000101.in_HCSX/com.sap.b1i.vplatform.runtime/INB_HT_CALL_SYNC_XPT/INB_HT_CALL_SYNC_XPT.ipo/proc/ServiceCalls
And this is the correct address?
The logs in your local preview do no represent what is sent to the destination. Appending pathPrefix: test will mean the destination is called as:
https://O1_Support-B1iF.dest/test
You can validate the destination in BAS by calling;
curl "$H2O_URL/destinations/O1_Support-B1iF/ServiceCalls" -vs > curl-B1iF-output.txt 2>&1
The destination is configured with BasicAuthentication and it settings are not part of your destination you need then to use;
curl -u : "$H2O_URL/destinations/O1_Support-B1iF/ServiceCalls" -vs > curl-B1iF-output.txt 2>&1
replacing the and
The generated output will tell you if the service call is working, any redirect or login issues.

2022-09-12 09:43:55 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hello, I tried to put "/" as a pathPrefix for the destinations but nothing changed, i also tried to put some garbage, but i still couldn't see any changes in the logs, Here is what the destinations definitions look like: - path: /B1i            destination: O1_Support-B1iF            url: https://vmsdevb1sql10-b1if.opti-one.fr/B1iXcellerator/exec/ipo/vP.0010000101.in_HCSX/com.sap.b1i.vplatform.runtime/INB_HT_CALL_SYNC_XPT/INB_HT_CALL_SYNC_XPT.ipo/proc pathPrefix: test          - path: /hana            destination: O1_Support-HANA            url: "https://o1addonskiaxrlage7.eu2.hana.ondemand.com/O1SUPPORT/DEV/Service.xsodata"            pathPrefix: test But i still have the same error in the B1iF logs, without any mention of the "test" pathPrefix i added. Is this an error? or am i doing it wrong? Regards,  2022-09-12 09:26:43 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
Sorry to hear this.
Your B1i destination URL on SAP BTP destination is configured as follows;

https://vmsdevb1sql10-b1if.opti-one.fr/B1iXcellerator/exec/ipo/vP.0010000101.in_HCSX/com.sap.b1i.vplatform.runtime/INB_HT_CALL_SYNC_XPT/INB_HT_CALL_SYNC_XPT.ipo/proc

using the ui5.yaml with these settings;

backend:
- path: /B1i
destination: O1_Support-B1iF
url: https://vmsdevb1sql10-b1if.opti-one.fr/B1iXcellerator/exec/ipo/vP.0010000101.in_HCSX/com.sap.b1i.vplatform.runtime/INB_HT_CALL_SYNC_XPT/INB_HT_CALL_SYNC_XPT.ipo/proc
pathPrefix: /
- path: /hana
destination: O1_Support-HANA
url: "https://o1addonskiaxrlage7.eu2.hana.ondemand.com/O1SUPPORT/DEV/Service.xsodata"

Means the request sent from your app to /B1i is
https://vmsdevb1sql10-b1if.opti-one.fr/B1iXcellerator/exec/ipo/vP.0010000101.in_HCSX/com.sap.b1i.vplatform.runtime/INB_HT_CALL_SYNC_XPT/INB_HT_CALL_SYNC_XPT.ipo/proc/B1i/ServiceCalls

You should be able to re-append the pathPrefix again;

- path: /B1i
destination: O1_Support-B1iF
url: https://vmsdevb1sql10-b1if.opti-one.fr/B1iXcellerator/exec/ipo/vP.0010000101.in_HCSX/com.sap.b1i.vplatform.runtime/INB_HT_CALL_SYNC_XPT/INB_HT_CALL_SYNC_XPT.ipo/proc
pathPrefix: /



2022-09-12 07:37:30 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hello, Sadly it looks like this problem isn't resolved yet. When i try to make a request to my B1i destination, it looks like the destination path is still added to the end of the url. I get the same error message : Server side cannot respond your request (No scenario step (vBIU) assigned for step for sender system (SysId) [0009] [incoming identifier = 'io']) when trying to make a request using the app (with the url 'B1i/ServiceCalls') or when i make a request using postman to the correct URL with B1i added before (so ' /B1i/ServiceCalls'. Is this still the configuration that has problems? Regards,  2022-09-09 14:52:59 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Solution provided: Hi,
With some minor configuration changes to the ui5.yaml the login 404 issue was resolved.
Also suggested using the start script rather than start-mock which was possibly causing this issue.
Here is additional information around running mock locally that might answer some of your questions;
https://blogs.sap.com/2021/11/01/sap-fiori-tools-2111-release-introduces-application-information-page-integrated-mock-data-more-deployment-options/

Hello, I think a call would be good, i'll send you a Teams invite. Regards,  2022-09-08 12:44:59 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
I cant re-create the 404 issue locally but I've replicated the destination on my subaccount and tried to post to the destination using;
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"email": "sqdf", "password": "5d7b9ebd01b0f88889618ed184497ba9"}' $H2O_URL/destinations/O1_Support-HANA/hana/login -vs > curl-datasrv-output.txt 2>&1
This returns a 303 and redirects me to a different page. Its now redirecting me to https://o1addonskiaxrlage7.eu2.hana.ondemand.com:443/sap/hana/xs/formLogin/login.html?x-sap-origin-location=%2FO1SUPPORT%2FDEV%2FService.xsodata%2Fhana%2Flogin
Is this expected? My understanding is you will get a CORRS issue since you are making a HTTP request from a different source!
It might be worth removing the package-lock and node_modules folder and rebuilding them again by running;
npm install
The pathPrefix is used to change the path against the destination i.e. anything calling /hana will now have /hana appended to the destination path, for example;
$H2O_URL/destinations/O1_Support-HANA/hana/
in turn calls
https://o1addonskiaxrlage7.eu2.hana.ondemand.com/O1SUPPORT/DEV/Service.xsodata/hana
If these paths are not exposed by the endpoint then you will get a 404.
Based on what you've shared soo far, the pathPrefix is fine with / thus anything locally calling /hana will be directed to
https://o1addonskiaxrlage7.eu2.hana.ondemand.com/O1SUPPORT/DEV/Service.xsodata/
You will notice, there is no hana path shown.
We can schedule a call Friday GMT +1 during business hours to discuss this further. My email is *EMAIL*.


2022-09-08 09:13:22 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hello, I created the log you asked for and added it to the attachments. I created 2 files, one with the pathPrefix options defined and one without, just to be sure. Hope this can help,  2022-09-08 09:01:03 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
Remember, in local preview mode you are running a local proxy to allow your application communicate via your SAP BTP destinations to the outside world.
The pathPrefix is away to handle request that are passed to the destination. So based on your change, the following will happen;
{ "path": "/hana", "destination": "O1_Support-HANA", "url": "https://o1addonskiaxrlage7.eu2.hana.ondemand.com/O1SUPPORT/DEV/Service.xsodata", "pathPrefix": "/hana" }
This will make a call via the BAS proxy to the following;
https://O1_Support-HANA.dest/hana
In your O1_Support-HANA destination on SAP BTP you have the following URL defined;

https://o1addonskiaxrlage7.eu2.hana.ondemand.com/O1SUPPORT/DEV/Service.xsodata

So the destination will forward this request to;

https://o1addonskiaxrlage7.eu2.hana.ondemand.com/O1SUPPORT/DEV/Service.xsodata/hana

Please remember, every local request to /hana will now be forwarded to destination with the /hana appended to it.
Can you please confirm if https://o1addonskiaxrlage7.eu2.hana.ondemand.com/O1SUPPORT/DEV/Service.xsodata/hana/login is a valid URL to handle the login request?
It might be worth providing some HAR files to understand more what requests are being made from your application;
A full network trace (.har file) with all requests in the scenario after it was reproduced. For how to extract trace follow this note - https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/1990706 and the browser console logs.
Please provide all the above requested logs in details to analysis the issue further.

2022-09-08 07:20:30 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hello, So from the link you sent, i need to add something to the "pathPrefix" section of the ui5.yaml file. I have added /hana for the hana path and /B1i for the B1i path; my ui5.yaml looks like this now: - path: /sap            url: https://vmsdevb1sql10-b1if.opti-one.fr/B1iXcellerator/exec/ipo/vP.0010000101.in_HCSX/com.sap.b1i.vplatform.runtime/INB_HT_CALL_SYNC_XPT/INB_HT_CALL_SYNC_XPT.ipo/proc destination: O1_Support-B1iF          - path: /B1i            destination: O1_Support-B1iF            url: https://vmsdevb1sql10-b1if.opti-one.fr/B1iXcellerator/exec/ipo/vP.0010000101.in_HCSX/com.sap.b1i.vplatform.runtime/INB_HT_CALL_SYNC_XPT/INB_HT_CALL_SYNC_XPT.ipo/proc pathPrefix: /B1i          - path: /hana            destination: O1_Support-HANA            url: "https://o1addonskiaxrlage7.eu2.hana.ondemand.com/O1SUPPORT/DEV/Service.xsodata"            pathPrefix: /hana Now if i try to make a request to the hana destination, do i need to change my url, or do i keep the "/hana/ " url that i was using before? Regards,  2022-09-07 16:18:03 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
So a 404 is a different issue, that indicates the application is able to start up correctly.
In your ui5.yaml you have defined the hana path as;

- path: /hana
destination: O1_Support-HANA
url: "https://o1addonskiaxrlage7.eu2.hana.ondemand.com/O1SUPPORT/DEV/Service.xsodata"
pathPrefix: /

When you make the ajax call to

"async": false,
"url": "/hana/login",
"method": "GET",
"cache": false,
"headers": {
"Content-Type": "application/json",
"X-CSRF-Token": "Fetch"
},

this is calling

https://o1addonskiaxrlage7.eu2.hana.ondemand.com/O1SUPPORT/DEV/Service.xsodata

/hana/login

Is this a valid URL? Does this URL exist?

Please refer to https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sap/ux-ui5-tooling and look for `changing the path to which a request is proxied`. You might need to tweak your path to suit the backend if the login path is different.



2022-09-07 14:41:57 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hello, I have a very similar ui5.yaml file to yours, with the url added in the /hana path. I still have the same 404 message when i make a request to it. How do you make a request to the destination? In this app, we use the $.ajax function, wich worked in the Web IDE. I added an example of how we make our requests. Are you making your requests differently? How should they be done in this new Environment? Regards,  2022-09-06 15:39:18 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
I've uploaded two files;
1. A sample ui5.yaml that has been changed with the correct details
2. The app running in local preview using `npm run start`
This confirms the app is starting up and trying to make API calls in local preview mode. I cant verify if the app loads correctly as Im receiving a login page.

There are aslo a number of failing api calls i.e.
GET http://localhost:8080/sap/es/ina/GetServerInfo?_=1662478649423 401 (Unauthorized)
This is because you have the following backend config in your ui5.yaml
- path: /sap
url: https://vmsdevb1sql10-b1if.opti-one.fr/B1iXcellerator/exec/ipo/vP.0010000101.in_HCSX/com.sap.b1i.vplatform.runtime/INB_HT_CALL_SYNC_XPT/INB_HT_CALL_SYNC_XPT.ipo/proc
destination: O1_Support-B1iF

Which indicates I dont have access to this URL or the endpoint does not expose sap/es/ina/GetServerInfo?_=1662478649423 as expected.

 2022-09-06 13:57:41 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hello, I checked the existing destination, and rectified the name in the ui5.yaml file, i also added the url, like you said, but i still can't make a request on the destination, i still get the same message. Am i doing something wrong in the app's definition? or am i maybe doing the requests wrong? Regards,  2022-09-06 08:41:47 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
Just to be clear, the destination defined on your SAP BTP account is
O1_Support-HANA
The one defined in your local Fiori app is
O1Support_HANA
The local app needs to be changed to O1_Support-HANA. You can confirm this by logging into your SAP BTP subaccount, select destinations and confirm the name and properties of the destination.
Please beware, when your local app starts up it also spins up a local proxy where it tries to make a call to the destination. If the destination fails or is not available it will drop down into the URL. In your case the URL is empty so it cant connect to anything! You can populate this URL with the URL defined in the destination properties i.e.

https://o1addonskiaxrlage7.eu2.hana.ondemand.com/O1SUPPORT/DEV/Service.xsodata

Then try restarting up your application in local preview mode again.

Thanks.

 2022-09-06 08:24:02 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hello, I changed every "O1Support_HANA" i could find to "O1_Support_HANA", but i still have the same Cannot GET /hana/login error whenever i try to make a request.  2022-09-05 16:03:40 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
After reviewing the generated outout, you have defined a path locally using `O1Support_HANA` but the actual destination exposed on your SAP BTP destinations is `O1_Support-HANA`. You need to update all references locally to `O1_Support-HANA` as this is spelt differently, this should resolve your issue with local preview.
 2022-09-05 14:14:54 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
I added the result of the Fiori environment check as an attachment, and all the destinations do exist, but when i try to make a request, i still get the "can't POST/GET on hana/B1i" Regards,  2022-09-05 08:17:16 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
Thank you for attaching the required files.
After looking at your ui5.yaml, you have three paths defined with two different destinations;

- path: /sap
url: https://vmsdevb1sql10-b1if.opti-one.fr/B1iXcellerator/exec/ipo/vP.0010000101.in_HCSX/com.sap.b1i.vplatform.runtime/INB_HT_CALL_SYNC_XPT/INB_HT_CALL_SYNC_XPT.ipo/proc
destination: O1_Support-B1iF
- path: /B1i
destination: O1_Support-B1iF
url: https://vmsdevb1sql10-b1if.opti-one.fr/B1iXcellerator/exec/ipo/vP.0010000101.in_HCSX/com.sap.b1i.vplatform.runtime/INB_HT_CALL_SYNC_XPT/INB_HT_CALL_SYNC_XPT.ipo/proc
pathPrefix: /
- path: /hana
destination: O1Support_HANA
url: ""
pathPrefix: /

Using the environement check, can you please provide the destination properties for the two destinations;

1. From SAP Business Application Studio, open command palette via View -> Find Command and enter "Fiori: Open Environment Check" -> Enter credentials if prompted -> Choose a location to save
2. A generated "Preview results.md" file is opened. Please check the section "Destination Details". SAP Fiori tools Environment Check will find and suggest if any destination parameters are missing.
Please remember, if the O1Support_HANA does not exist on your subaccount destination list then it will fail back to the URL, in the case of the O1Support_HANA destination this is empty. Also when this gets deployed to Cloud Foundry, it will not work either unless the destination is available.
To validate your subaccount destinations exist either review the generated md results from above or via your SAP BTP cockpit;
1. Now, Log on to the SAP BTP cockpit as an administrator. From your global account, navigate to your Cloud Foundry environment subaccount.
2. In the navigation area, choose Connectivity -> Destinations.

Hi Colleagues,

Customer migrated a Web IDE application to BAS using the Fiori migratoin tools.
The npm start fails with this message
error fiori-tools-proxy Failed to regiser backend for /hana. Check configuration in yaml file.

Could you check it further, SAP Note
3220573 - Business Application Studio cannot launch Fiori Application due to error 'Failed to register backend for /sap. Check configuration in yaml file.'
seems to be related.

Best regards,

I added the screenshots to the attachments tab of this incident. When i make the migration, i already have a problem, i can only select one destination, but i use two in my app, one for login and user administration and one for the actual data. The first one is a hana database, while the other is a B1iF installation. When i try to launch the app even with half of my destinations missing, i have the following error:error fiori-tools-proxy Failed to register backend for /hana. Check configuration in yaml file. But even then, i don't have any problem with the migration process, i already found your tutorial, and following it always seems to create an error. What i want to do is just use the destinations i created in the cockpit, like i could in Web IDE, how can i do that? What changed? and what do i need to update in my app to make it work?

Hello ,
Could you update here what exact notification you get? (screenshot)
Please also take step-by-step screenshots of the migration steps done according to the following blog page: https://blogs.sap.com/2022/01/10/its-time-to-plan-your-move-to-sap-business-application-studio/

I have a notification saying there's something new, here, but i can't see anything, i still have the same issue 2022-08-05 09:35:39 -  (I345986) (External Info)
Hello ,
Thank you for our time on the chat!
Could you take the app migration according to the following blog? https://blogs.sap.com/2022/01/10/its-time-to-plan-your-move-to-sap-business-application-studio/
If the destiantions are still problematic after this, then let me know. As it seems that the destination itself is reached, but segment 'hana' is missing (or searched incorrectly), I might need to involve Hana team.

Component: CA-UI5-COR

Hello,

I'm trying to port my SAPUI5 apps from the WebIDE, and in thoses apps, i use destinations to connect to my data services.

In this case, i use two, one is a hana database, the other is the url to a B1iF package.

The destinations have the HTML5.DynamicDestination set to true.

I tried adding them to my ui5.yaml file, but to no avail:

backend:          - path: /hana            url: https://o1addonskiaxrlage7.eu2.hana.ondemand.com/O1SUPPORT/DEV/Service.xsodata            destination: O1_Support-HANA          - path: /B1i            url: https://vmsdevb1sql10-b1if.opti-one.fr/B1iXcellerator/exec/ipo/vP.0010000101.in_HCSX/com.sap.b1i.vplatform.runtime/INB_HT_CALL_SYNC_XPT/INB_HT_CALL_SYNC_XPT.ipo/proc            destination: O1_Support-B1iF

When i try to make a request, i get this error:
Resource not found for the segment 'hana' at position 0.

What am i doing wrong?

This is using a connection to an on premise gateway server. Every $batch request 403s with a response of "CSRF token validation failed". In the App manifest.js we can disable the $batch with the setting "useBatch": false Then the apps work without problem. But this is nothing we want to use for our productive apps.

Please refer to previous post with details of a possible solution.
Thanks.

Hi,
Sorry to hear you are having these issues with Fiori Tools. I've reviewed your attachments and here a number of steps to help resolve the issue;
Step 1. Remove odata_gen fron your destination WebIDEUsage since its a catalog of services you are exposing and not a single odata service Step 2. Understanding CSRF tokens https://blogs.sap.com/2021/06/04/how-does-csrf-token-work-sap-gateway/this is a great blog to undersetand more around csrf tokens using the SAP gateway Step 3. $batch mode is failing with CSRF 403, you have two options;
Option 1. you can disable batch processing, update your manifest.json as shown, using the useBatch property as false will disable the request;
"sap.ui5": { "models": { "yourV2ODataModel": { "dataSource": "yourDataSource", "settings": { "useBatch": false } } } }
click configuration

 2022-04-26 06:13:45 -  (I031776) (Internal Info)
Dear Colleagues ,
The calls are going out from Fiori preview run/generator, I suspect there are mix of destinations used which "confuses" the  when working with service to  flow (which is stateless).
Any CUD actions calls that requires a csrf should also do a csrf Fetch just before the the CUD calls, otherwise the CSRF will not match the backend cookie.
Currently it seems that  doesn't support this kind of multi backends use.
If you can't do the above option , please discuss the issue with  colleagues (BC-XS-APR)
Thanks and best regards  2022-04-25 06:14:46 -  (I055995) (Internal Info)
Hi Roy,
The issue you refer to is related to Preview of UI Adaptation. This customer is creating a fiori app from template and using npm to run their start script which open the running app on a new tab and all requests are going straight to the proxy (without theia involvement). So this issue is not related to the one your referred to. As theia is not involved we have no way to assist here. Please continue on your side. Thanks and regards,  2022-04-21 14:29:47 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hello, I did attach 2 videos. I am generating a simple fiori elements app. and then testing it. R3 Connection for E94 and T10 is open. br 2022-04-17 13:22:11 -  (I501378) (External Info)
Dear Customer,
Can you please send us steps to reproduce this problem?

Dear Colleagues
We discussed the issue in the past (with Rotem) . there were two options here
- When the new VScode will replace Theia - this was also what extension asked for - Extension will use a different api then what was used in Watt, which maintain a connection session that is not relevant for BAS.
From ESM we can't do much , please take over

Thanks and regards Roy

2022-04-14 06:33:00 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Dear Roy, the app in the example was a simple Fiori Elements app. The problem also exists when creating a new app with only using the Fiori Elements generation wizard. So basically I can not change the flow of the calls. And as I mentioned before, doing the same in WebIDE works without a problem. br  2022-04-13 18:10:46 -  (I031776) (External Info)
Dear Customer,
Thanks for the additional details ,
From the har file I can see that the flow starts to get 403 response at some time.
This I think happens because the client calls different odata services in an interlace manner, for example
calling : https://port8080-workspaces-ws-x77q7.eu10.applicationstudio.cloud.sap/sap/opu/odata/sap/ZFIORI_STS_PAYOUT_HISTORY_SRV/?sap-client=010
Then next call is
https://port8080-workspaces-ws-x77q7.eu10.applicationstudio.cloud.sap/sap/opu/odata/sap/ESH_SEARCH_SRV/ServerInfos?$expand=Services/Capabilities
Which fails on 403

Each of these call returns an encrypted ARBE cookie that is holding the connection, but then the client sends wrong cookie to different services and hence the csrf validation fails.

To resolve this, try to change the client flow, so it will not do these interlace calls, or not reuse a cookie that was meant for one service with a different one.
You can do that by adding a call a Fetch csrf without the ARBE cookie, then call should be successful and return a csrf token and a match cookie, then use that csrf and ARBE cookie with the $batch request
Hope it helps to solve your issue Let me know of your results
Thanks and best regards Roy
2022-04-13 13:48:54 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Attached please find the files you requested.
Also for your 3rd question: The endpoint is working as soon as I deactive the $batch in the manifest.js with the setting: useBatch": false Only calls with $batch are receiving an error. 2022-04-12 15:26:35 -  (I031776) (External Info)

Hello colleagues,
could you please advise the customer? There is little that Fiori tools (CA-UX-IDE) can do, because we are not the one managing the authentication and setting the BAS Session Cookies.

Hi,
Getting closer!
Try these in your Windows OS environment variables or by updating your bash profile;
# No Proxy settings export no_proxy=*.sap.com,*.local export NO_PROXY=*.sap.com,*.local
You might need to tweak these to suit your own local setup.

Dear , I think I found the problem. To get arround the error with the appinsight I need to set the following variables HTTP_PROXY HTTPS_PROXY When those are set however, I cannot connect to the local SAP server, because the proxy is a cloud service it does not know about the local machine. so what is needed is a way to use the proxy settings for all external server but don't use the proxy server for internal servers. How do I do that? Best regards  2022-04-12 15:49:02 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)

Hi,
Just a note, if you are running vscode and running the npm deploy command from the integrated terminal in vscode, please ensure the proxy settings are empty as it will then pick up your Windows OS environment variables. Again, please refer to your Windows OS settings on how to append the proxy, http_proxy and https_proxy settings to your OS environment variables.
 2022-04-12 13:19:31 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
You can set the following flag to disable any of the telemetry in Fiori Tools;
export SAP_UX_FIORI_TOOLS_DISABLE_TELEMETRY=false
and then re-run the deploy command again.
Or run it as follows;
SAP_UX_FIORI_TOOLS_DISABLE_TELEMETRY=false npm run deploy
or again, update your bash/npm profiles or Windows OS environment variables.
As regards your last comment regarding the proxy server, you would need to confirm with your IT Admin if your setup is correct. For example, can your Windows Server machine communicate with the abap backend hosted internally on your company network via the cloud proxy server. You could try a curl command to see what kind of response you get, for example;
curl -u : "https://srv-s4hasd-01.hagebau.local"
or
curl "https://srv-s4hasd-01.hagebau.local"
Please let me know if this works.
Thanks.

According to the colleagues the URL for the proxy is correct. Please note: The proxy server is a cloud service and not located within the company network. I don't know if that makes any difference.
Best regards  2022-04-12 11:48:35 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
Further to my previous post, depending on your OS configuration, the following might work as well;
Open your ~/.npmrc and append the following;
https_proxy = "http://gateway.zscaler.net:80/"
Your npm config will list the following proxy settings now; https_proxy = "http://gateway.zscaler.net:80/"https-proxy = "http://gateway.zscaler.net:80/"proxy = "http://gateway.zscaler.net:80/"
There is a difference between an underscore and hyphen which is required by different tools installed on your OS.
You might also need to append the following, if making any non-SSL calls;
http_proxy = "http://gateway.zscaler.net:80/"http-proxy = "http://gateway.zscaler.net:80/"
Again, verify with your IT Admin, the host for both SSL and non-SSL calls are correct.

Hi,
The npmrc profile is only read when you are using npm commands i.e. npm install where it locates the proxy in order to retrive the required npm modules, when you are run npm run deploy it is starting up a  process which will read your system environment variables.
Since you are using a Windows OS, please follow these steps;
Open System Properties.
Open Environment Variables.
Open System variables.
Set http_proxy and https_proxy to the location of your proxy server.
These values MUST be lowercase.
These steps might be different for your specific Windows OS version, please refer to the Microsoft OS site for further steps.
Also, if you are using a subsystem like bash, you can configure your environment as follows per terminal session;
export http_proxy='http://proxyServerSddress:proxyPort'
export https_proxy='https://proxyServerSddress:proxyPort' Or edit the bash profile and add these permanently so they are applied each time your shell is opened.
Your IT Admin might need to provide you with admin privileges to allow you both install a subsystem or to edit your environmental variables.
Please let me know if this works.

Dear , I talked to the colleagues. According to them, the SBAS tries to connect to the server without using the proxy and therefore fails (the firewall blocks the request). In the .npmrc file I specified the proxy, and according to the system, the proxy is used. If I type npm config get proxy I get the following result http://gateway.zscaler.net:80/ and for the https npm config get https-proxy I get the following result http://gateway.zscaler.net:80/ What do I need to change to make sure the following step uses the proxy?

Hi,
The changes you made to the yaml file will not work unless you have some proxy translating the url https://srv-s4hasd-01.hagebau.local into an endpoint that SBAS can reach.
Can you confirm with your IT admin if the corporate proxy is able to communicate with the endpoint? Using the appropiate port? If SBAS is unable route to it, then deployed request will fail.

Dear , yes, we are running behing a corporate firewall. I also changes to yaml file to url: https://srv-s4hasd-01.hagebau.local port: "8443" without any success The IP address within the error message is not a server of the company. This IP address also changes almost every time, when I try to deploy. I assume this server is contacted as part of the deployment process, also I don't not why and for what purpose.

Hi,
Sorry to hear this is still happening.
Based on your .npmrc file, you are running a corporate proxy or firewall that might be blocking this request using SSL?
ECONNREFUSED indicates the port 443 as described in the error is not open.
You might need to confirm with your network admin team if the URL defined in the ui5-deploy.yaml supports SSL and is running port 443 and also supports outbound connections from machine on port 443.

Hi,
This is a down to issues with the client/server SSL certificates used by .
As a quick hack to verify you can connect, can you update your shell with the following environment variable;
ENV NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0
Or before your Fiori command, as follows;
NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0 npm run deploy-test
This will disable TLS validation for HTTP requests using the  process. This is highly insecure so its better to find a working solution.
You will need to verify your version of  but you should be able to load the appropiate certs as follows;
process.env["NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS"] = "C:\Users\Documents\1.pem";

Hi ,
thanks for the confirmation. In the attachment regarding your environment I saw that you have 2 destinations "DFI100" and "DFI200". What is the difference between them? Is it only the sap-client? Hence DFI100 is sap-client=100 and DFI200 is sap-client=200? If yes, could you please update the "ui5.yaml" of your application with the following property client: "100"? Put it just below the destination property. Afterwards please start the application and check if the issue is re-occurring.

Hi ,
This customer is complaining that everytime they preview their app, they have to enter their credentials which seems like doesn't go through and they have to restart their dev space.
I got their environment check and project. TO me. nothing is popping out. Please note that seems like customer was able to generate the project using same destination and also create deployment configuration, so its very unlikely that there is issue with credentials/connections.
My next obvious feedback to customer can be to clear their cache, but I just wnated to run by you in case you have different solution/opinion in mind.

Hi Team, Thank for reaching out. Yes the issue has been resolved by itself. We belive it has something to do with the BAS. Requesting you to close the ticket. Thanks  2022-10-11 18:36:17 -  (I829208) (External Info)
Hi ,
Thank you very much for your patience on this. I wanted to give you an update.
After you created this issue, it went through few components before landing with us at CA-UX-IDE (SAP Fiori tools). We also got in touch with UI5 repo service colleagues to find how we can enhance SAP Fiori tools to handle this error from backend more gracefully.
I am happy to tell you that we now have a backlog in place and solution in mind. So once this feature is developed, SAP Fiori tools will handle the error like this one which you reported in a better way. As you would understand, I cannot commit on this enhancement delivery. PLease stay tuned with our release notes.

And irrespective of this enhancement we are doing, coming back to your reported scenario, can you please comment on the correct status? Seems you have commented in the community page that you were able to resolve this issue for now. The error you are getting from backend is correct. Anyways, please tell how we can assist you further on this or we can close this incident.
Thanks much.
Best Regards,

On Oct 10 we groom this ticket. Once we have some direction, I will ask the customer to possibly close this ticket. Keeping it open just in case we need some more info from customer. 2022-10-05 14:20:27 -  (I829208) (Internal Info)
yeah we are currently in discussion to handle this issue gracefully in FT. Its not a bug but a new feature. I will link the ticket as soon as I created one after some discussion. 2022-10-05 10:03:12 -  (I313149) (Internal Info)
Our odata-client has the following code;
return isExisting ? await httpClient.put(`/Repositories('${encodeURIComponent(appName)}')`, payload, config) : await httpClient.post('/Repositories', payload, config);
isExisting is determined by the following piece of code;
public async getInfo(app: string): Promise { try { return await this.get (`/Repositories('${encodeURIComponent(app)}')`); } catch (error) { return undefined; } }
In response to  rquestion, the POST is being executed since the app does not exist! Or at least the /Repositories is not returning the app info.
This code is nearly 18months old, we need to confirm if there is a change in behaviour or if there is still the correct way to determine the presence of the app on the target system.
 2022-10-01 15:49:55 -  (D041307) (Internal Info)
Hello colleagues,
the error message indicates that the deployer wrongly sends a POST although it should send a PUT to update an existing repository.
Are you able to extract any network trace or deployer log, why it sends a POST?
Regards  2022-09-30 18:05:10 -  (I829208) (Internal Info)
Dear CA-UI5-ABA-SAR colleagues,
We need your help here. So this customer is getting error code 409 SAPUI5 ABAP Repository with name ZEHSM_RTSMS already exists error when deploying their app.
Can you suggest what can be next course of action for customer or is it something Fiori tools can improve upon on handling this scenario.
Customer also mentions that he is able to use "/UI5/UI5_REPOSITORY_LOAD" to bypass this. I would have expected the same error here too.

Regards,

CA-UX-IDE

Hi,
Can you please confirm, by logging into SBAS and selecting Service Center tab, if your destinations load correctly? If these return errors or dont return the system or destination properties, then the destinations are still misconfigured.
We can organise a call, will it be possible to have the developers responsble for setting up the backend host environment? These developers will be required to confirm that the cloud connectors and catalogs are setup correctly.
 2021-07-05 12:59:29 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hello , As per the links provided by you, we have checked our configuration and it is the same, still we are getting the issue. Could you kindly check the issue ? Thanks and Regards,  2021-07-05 10:37:11 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Please refer to previous post with further details on resolving your issue.
 2021-07-05 10:35:16 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
Referring to the question on `WebIDEAdditionalData`, you need to confirm what the host "Host":"http://s4hanacloud.sap.cree.com:44300" is exposing i.e. service URL or a catalog. Please refer to the folllwing links;
https://help.sap.com/viewer/825270ffffe74d9f988a0f0066ad59f0/CF/en-US/f6e4fac5a91d42f1a2552678d718d5af.html and https://help.sap.com/viewer/825270ffffe74d9f988a0f0066ad59f0/CF/en-US/5c3debce758a470e8342161457fd6f70.html
This is very important as there are different flows in our Fiori Elements tooling, to support the different types of endpoints/destinations;
For example, if you expose a catalog endpoint; WebIDEUsage with odata_abap and the host http://s4hanacloud.sap.cree.com:44300 then we are expecting the endpoint to be a catalog of services, which will expose your V2 or V4 services that we can consume. Specifying `odata_abap` requires the PATH /sap/opu/odata to be exposed for the OData functionality of the Gateway to work.
If you are setting up a service URL then currently, our Fiori Tools dont support full service URL's as a data source but this functionality is being tested and will be available in the coming weeks.
However, when logged into SBAS, there is a now a Service Centre tab on the left navigation bar that will show you all the destinations exposed to you. You can select your chosen destination to validate if its configured correctly and then create a Fiori Elements application from it, this will support either catalog or service destinations. Please note, if these dont return the system and service properties, then your destination are still not configured correctly and thus will not work inside our Fiori Tools.
I've reviewed your attachments as well; The reason you are getting a 404 when calling the destination is that the backend is still not configured correctly as the host specified is still not exposing either a service or a catalog;
Please refer to SAP Help or the SAP forums, for example https://blogs.sap.com/2019/03/27/how-to-guide-connectivity-setup-with-abap-and-sap-cloud-connector/
Please beaware; Specifying `odata_abap` requires the PATH /sap/opu/odata to be exposed for the OData functionality of Gateway Speecifying `odata_gen` is for generic OData functionality (service URL must be provided manually)
Your destination config is as follows;
{ "Name":"DS4_CLONING", "Type":"HTTP", "Authentication":"NoAuthentication", "ProxyType":"OnPremise", "WebIDEAdditionalData":"api_mgmt,full_url", "Description":"S4 Development System", "WebIDEEnabled":"true", "sap-client":"400", "WebIDESystem":"DS4", "WebIDEUsage":"odata_abap,ui5_execute_abap,dev_abap,bsp_execute_abap,plugin_repository,odata_xs,api_mgmt_catalog,api_mgmt_proxy,odata_smp,odata_hcp_odp,odata_hci,hci_ifl_node,smart_business_odata,smart_business_gen", "Host":"http://s4hanacloud.sap.cree.com:44300", "WebIDEExposedHost":"s4hanacloud.sap.cree.com:44300" }
You have the following config
"WebIDEAdditionalData":"api_mgmt,full_url"
but then you specify `"Host":"http://s4hanacloud.sap.cree.com:44300",` which is not a full_url. For example, https://services.odata.org/V2/Northwind/Northwind.svc/ is a full service URL endpoint since its returning a service rather than a catalog. A catalog or a service catalog returns the list of exposed services for your endpoint where our Fiori tool will then read the list and give you a dropdown list showing the v2 and v4 services.
Please refer to this tutorial for more details on setting up services and catalogs;
https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/abap-environment-deploy-cf-production.html#4866d917-8fe7-4ef5-9910-7cd33ff42a2f
You need to confirm how your endpoint is configured `http://s4hanacloud.sap.cree.com:44300`, is this behind a proxy, is this exposing a service or a catalog? Configuring your endpoint to be a service catalog, means that full_url is not applicable and should be removed from your destination properties. The best way of validating your endpoint is using the curl commands provided in the previous post;
a. curl $H2O_URL/api/listDestinations -> list all your destinations b. curl "$H2O_URL/destinations/DS4_CLONING/" - to call a full service endpoint c. curl "$H2O_URL/destinations/DS4_CLONING/sap/opu/odata/IWFND/CATALOGSERVICE;v=2/ServiceCollection" - to call a catalog endpoint
Any of the generators on SBAS will be making these calls so until these return valid JSON our tooling is not going to work.
Can you speak to the developers who are configuring your endpoints or cloud connectors? They need to confirm the specific endpoints for you and will make the necessary changes to allow you connect into them as the cloud connector may need to be configured as well.
I'm reducing the severity of this ticket to a high as this seems to be an issue with configuration rather than with our tooling.
We can arrange a call this week once you have confirmed the endpoint is configured correctly, as our Fiori Elements tooling is only a consumber of these endpoints and we have limited support in configuring or supporting the backend endpoints as these configurations can be unique from customer to customer.

Hello ,
Please find the below point:
1. You have specified full_url for the WebIDEAdditionalData attributes but the URL specified is not a full service url i.e. https://services.odata.org/V2/Northwind/Northwind.svc/ this is considered a full service URL Could you kindly let us know what needs to be mentioned in WebIDEAdditionalData ? We are not clear on this part.
2. You have specified both odata_abap and odata_gen which mean different things i.e. odata_gen are for systems that expose services URL's, while odata_abap is used for OData functionality of Gateway (corresponds to URL path /sap/opu/odata) Enter either the odata_abap value or the odata_gen value. Do not use both values at the same time. : We have maintained the value odata_abap and removed odata_gen
3. You can validate if your destination is configured correctly from SBAS, open a new terminal and use the following commands replacing with DS4_CLONING
a. curl $H2O_URL/api/listDestinations -> list all your destinations : Attached file "BAS_Destinations"b. curl "$H2O_URL/destinations//" - to call a full service destination : Attached file "BAS_full service"c. curl "$H2O_URL/destinations//sap/opu/odata/IWFND/CATALOGSERVICE;v=2/ServiceCollection" - to call a catalog destination : Attached file "BAS_catlog" Please find attached files for reference. Thanks and Regards,  2021-07-02 14:56:29 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,

I've reviewed your attachments and I've some feedback;
When you try to validate the DS4_CLONING destination in BTP Cockpit, it's only pinging the destination, its not validating if the service/catalog is available.
In your destination, you have specified a number of properties which seem inconsistent; 1. You have specified full_url for the WebIDEAdditionalData attributes but the URL specified is not a full service url i.e. https://services.odata.org/V2/Northwind/Northwind.svc/ this is considered a full service URL 2. You have specified both odata_abap and odata_gen which mean different things i.e. odata_gen are for systems that expose services URL's, while odata_abap is used for OData functionality of Gateway (corresponds to URL path /sap/opu/odata)
Enter either the odata_abap value or the odata_gen value. Do not use both values at the same time.
3. You can validate if your destination is configured correctly from SBAS, open a new terminal and use the following commands replacing with DS4_CLONING
a. curl $H2O_URL/api/listDestinations -> list all your destinations b. curl "$H2O_URL/destinations/ /" - to call a full service destination c. curl "$H2O_URL/destinations/ /sap/opu/odata/IWFND/CATALOGSERVICE;v=2/ServiceCollection" - to call a catalog destination
Please note, if you have not exposed either the service or the catalog then these API calls will not work.
I can refer you to a tutorial that might give you some further details around exposing catalogs

Hello ,

That is correct, the launch configuration for the Application Preview has to be "node" and you should not change that.
You need to add additional launch configuration for browser so the VSCode can connect to the running browser and then use that after starting the Application Preview task. (you'll have two running tasks, one for hosting the application and another for debugging it)
For more details please see the related VSCode documentation https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/browser-debugging
Best regards,
 2022-12-12 15:11:54 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hello , The current launch configuration's type is "type": "node". as provided in the previous ticket. What would be a good "type" I should use to run use this with Edge? Thank you!  2022-12-12 14:12:40 -  (C5226337) (External Info)
Hello ,
Yes, you can also do this with Edge, you would just need to use a different "type" in the launch configuration.
Best regards,
 2022-12-12 13:49:40 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hello , Yes, you are absolutely right.  That's what I am trying to do, and the workaround you provided - debug via the browser debugger is what I am doing as an alternate solution. Just a stupid question though re DevTools for Chrome.  Would this work also for Microsoft Edge? Thank you!  2022-12-12 13:45:09 -  (C5226337) (External Info)
Dear Customer,

I think I was able to reproduce the issue with the following steps. Did you perform similar steps as these?
1. Put a breakpoint in a controller code
2. Start app preview script in debug mode
3. Run Debug: Diagnose Breakpoint Problems
4. Click Why my breakpoints don't bind

This way you attach to the node process which is serving the app files, however I assume you want to debug the app it self in which case you need to attach to the browser process instead. To do that you would need to use an extension like this https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=codemooseus.vscode-devtools-for-chrome.
Alternatively you can use the browser Developer Tools to debug the application from there.

Dear Customer,

There is a pre-release version of the extension attached that includes the fix.
Could you please check if the issue you reported is no longer reproducible with the provided version of the extension?

You need to extract the .vsix file and then drag it to the extension panel in the VSCode or run "Extensions: Install from VSIX..." command and select the file.

Please transfer it to him. We are in a phase of moving our Fiori applications from Web IDE to BAS. One of the problems we encountered is the transfer of Plugin applications to BAS. When importing the application zip file downloaded from the Web IDE, the import wizard doesn't fire the migration step as it should. The application folder receives the application files as they were in the web IDE. I couldn't find a way to progress with them... We have two plugin applications in our Fiori implementation: zFioriPlugin - responsible for the Piwik reports initialization zDynatracePlugin - responsible for the Dynatrace reports initialization I am attaching both zip files from the web IDE Thank you for your help.

Hi ,

Yes, that's no problem.  I have your email address and will notify you when we support migration of plugins in BAS.  Please note that this is not a confirmed commitment from SAP that this feature will be delivered, but we are working actively in the background on this. I will let you know of the progress.
Best regards,

2022-06-19 05:16:37 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi , Thank you. I think this issue is clear now. I will close this incident. Will it be possible to get some message from you when the automate migration of plugins will be ready? Best regards  2022-06-17 10:59:52 -  (I305274) (External Info)
Hi ,

Yes, in order for the "deploy-config" target to run, you need to have the SAP Fiori generator installed globally, as this it what is used to generate the configuration.   You also need @sap/ux-ui5-tooling in the project locally (npm i @sap/ux-ui5-tooling --save-dev).  Finally, you would also need the server section in the ui5.yaml file, yes.  This is required currently for deploy config to run.

As I say, hopefully our tooling can be updated soon to automate migration of plugins.  The feedback you have given will help with our implementation.

Regards,


2022-06-16 08:15:46 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi , Thank you for instructions. I applied them in a new workspace. it seems to be working. On one of my plugins (zDynatracePlugin) I had to install also @sap/ui5-builder-webide-extension to make it work. the project didn't have a webapp folder and the files package.json & ui5.yaml didn't exist. I had to create them from scratch. I originally created this project using the webIDE wizard for plugin and I didn't have to build it. only deploy directly. I don't see a big difference between your instructions and the process I did by myself.  (in the attached file) I think the ui5-deploy.json can be generated using a deploy-config script ("deploy-config": "fiori add deploy-config") but @sap/generator-fiori has to be installed and a server part has to be added to the ui5.yaml. Am I right? Thank you for your help. Best regards  2022-06-14 16:14:06 -  (I305274) (External Info)
Hi,

I'm communicating that currently our tooling doesn't support migrating plugin libraries in an automated fashion, and we are looking to improve this.  In the meantime, you will have to migrate each plugin application in a manual fashion.  There are a lot of steps. Can you please complete the following for each project:

- Update the package.json to include the Fiori tooling dependency by executing npm i @sap/ux-ui5-tooling --save-dev

- Update the package.json to include the dependency by executing npm i ui5-task-flatten-library --save-dev

- Update to the latest version of the UI5/CLI library by executing npm install --save-dev @ui5/cli@latest

- Update the package.json ui5 dependencies with:

"ui5": {
"dependencies": [
// ...
"ui5-task-flatten-library",
// ...
]

- Add a new target to the package.json (you should already have a target for "build"):

"deploy": "npm run build && fiori deploy --config ui5-deploy.yaml && rimraf archive.zip"

- Add the following to your ui5.yaml file in the customTasks section:

- name: ui5-task-flatten-library
afterTask: generateResourcesJson

Create a new ui5-deploy.yaml file with the following contents (modify as needed for the sections contained in <>):

# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://sap.github.io/ui5-tooling/schema/ui5.yaml.json
specVersion: "2.5" metadata: name: type: application builder: resources: excludes: - /test/** - /localService/** customTasks: - name: deploy-to-abap afterTask: generateCachebusterInfo configuration: target: url: app: name: package: transport:

- Run npm run deploy to deploy your application.

Hi thanks for your answer. Based on our situation what are you suggesting? The result of your investigation will get answers in more than a month? What should we do? 2022-06-14 11:01:12 -  (I305274) (External Info)
Hi ,

I wanted to come back to you with an update to your support case.  I am one of the product owners for the SAP Fiori tools suite.  You are quite correct with your comments, and unfortunately this is a gap in our automated tooling.

We have been investigating a solution to this, with a view to updating our tools to accommodate this issue as soon as we can.

Thanks again for your feedback.

Best regards,
 2022-06-09 05:36:03 -  (I829208) (Internal Info)
HI ,
Let me reply to this customer.

Thanks 2022-06-07 12:48:55 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi,
Thank you for your answer. These are indeed plugins. I finally succeeded to build and deploy to our on premise gateway.
The Build task was still in the package.json and it worked.
For deploy-config & deploy, I copied the tasks from a successfully migrated project.
First I had to install npm install @sap/ui5-builder-webide-extension (the one you pointed to Then I had to install npm install -g @sap/generator-fiori Then I copied the server part in ui5.yaml from a successfully migrated application (attached Plugin Deploy.docx) After this, I was able to setup & deploy the app to the backend system. Still, not all the files of the application were deployed but only the ones that were changed.
I suppose I will be able to do it again next time. But I was expecting all this stuff to be done during the project migration at import like the other applications.
SAP wanted so much to be flexible that they forgot to make the work efficient. I couldn't find any definitive help or cookbook explaining the meaning of these libraries and why they are needed.
I am programming in the Web IDE for a long time now and I feel  a great disappointment with this new tool.
Best regards  2022-06-03 12:36:56 -  (I320242) (External Info)
Hello , These look like UI5 plugins. Migration is not needed for plugins to use them in BAS. If you extract the plugins into the BAS workspace and use the Fiori application that references the plugin(s) to preview it should work OK. Please use the wizard from here to link them locally Adding Reference to Reuse a Library & more detail of manual config here UI5 Tooling - serve static middleware Kind regards, . 2022-06-01 09:52:11 -  (I349897) (Internal Info)
Dear Colleagues,
When the customer is importing the application zip file downloaded from the Web IDE, the import wizard doesn't fire the migration step as it should.
This issue is related to the migration tool from WebIDE to BAS and not related to the Launchpad service.
Please assist here.
Thanks,

Hi,
Based on the attached PDF, the UI5 core was loaded correctly! However, it's hard to establish a root cause without looking at the full network call log which could be related to other failing network calls!
If this happens again, please follow these instructions to produce a full network trace (.har file) with all requests in the reproduced scenario https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/1990706
Another option is to login to your SAP BTP cockpit, select your subaccount, select your space, select your application and select logs. These logs might indicate if there is a backend issue.
Sorry I can't be of more help but it's hard to give a full explanation without some additional logs.

Hi colleagues,
According to the other case and the attached file "BAS - App Issue Doc.pdf" in this case, there were some disruption in loading SAPUI5 resources from the system (There is zero info from which system or how they're are actually loaded). As SAPUI5 is purely a client-side JavaScript framework, we can't answer why the resources could not be served last week. Now everything seems to work fine which indicates it might be a cache issue. The customer want to know what caused the issue.
Could you please continue with this case?
Thanks & regards,

An open source component which is consumed as part of the "@sap/ux-ui5-tooling" is missing the correct mapping for the "pathPrefix" property. The fix for this issue will be released with the next version (1.7.4) of "@sap/ux-ui5-tooling".
I will check when the version is due to be released and will updated you first thing tomorrow. Meanwhile the workaround is to replace pathPrefix with pathReplace.
Again, sorry about the inconvenience.
Best regards,

The Fiori tools team 2022-09-15 08:53:08 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)

Dear customer,
my name is  and I am one of the ui5-tooling experts. Could we please have another screen sharing session to investigate the issue further? If yes, please send me a MS Team meeting request at "*EMAIL*". The proposed time 8:30 to 10:30 works also for me.

Hello , Attached json details from both the spaces. Thanks,  2022-09-14 15:40:46 -  (I057368) (External Info)
Hi All,
Thank you for taking the time to share your issue with me in the call.

Current status:

The working instance is running an older version of node by changing the prefix to use the node 14.
It is also using an old version of the @sap/ux-ui5-tooling module 1.5.0
When connecting to the same reused destination OData $metadata endpoint the ARBE cookie is passed and a 200 status OK is returned.

The not working system is running with the default node version 16 and the latest @sap/ux-ui5-tooling 1.7.3 (upgraded during the session from 1.7.1)
When running the preview the same destination the ARBE cookie is not passed to the OData $metadata endpoint, and the status is 403
Down grading the project to use `@sap/ux-ui5-tooling` did not work, so there is likely some other difference.

Full list of dependencies form `npm ls --json` will be attached for comparison, in case there are other relevant differences.
The package.json is the same but when the package-lock.json was generated is different.

I am going to forward this issue to anther colleague that can better support the ui5-tooling module issue.

Best Regards,
. 2022-09-13 10:54:39 -  (I057368) (External Info)
Hi ,
Unfortunately the provided information is not sufficient to determine the difference between the two workspaces in order to determine why one is failing.
As agree I have scheduled a zoom meeting that should allow me to share your screen and determine the issue faster.

Hello , Please find the extension details attached . Can you please schedule an session in between 9 to 10 for 13/9 or anytime in between 8.30 to 10.30 for the rest of the week. Thanks,  2022-09-09 19:58:49 -  (I057368) (Internal Info)
Customer system is running node 14 on one dev space.
It should have been updated to node 16.
It is unclear why it has not updated.

Note that fixing this issue may cause both, dev spaces to stop being able to preview, but that is likely to be then fixed by upgrading the versioningof ui5-tooling used in the application. 2022-09-09 19:54:38 -  (I057368) (External Info)
Hi ,
Thank you for providing those images.
Unfortunately they do not provide sufficient information as they do not show all the extensions.
Instead can you attach the following file from the 2 workspaces.
`/extbin/generators/simple-extension-yo-install-output.txt` or `/extbin/generators/simple-extension-yo-install-output.txt.orig`
This shows the exact versions and the log of the extensions being installed.

I note however that you have the `HTML 5 Application template` extension installed.
As this is not able to install in a new dev space due to the fact that it is out of date and depends on an old version of node, perhaps this extension is blocking the upgrade of the first dev space and thus causing the difference.

After this maybe we can schedule an online screen sharing next week to speed up the information sharing.

Best regards,

Hello , I have attached both the screenshot of working and non working space extensions. Thanks  2022-09-09 09:08:59 -  (I057368) (External Info)
Hi ,
Thank you for that information.
It confirms that the latest versions of the fiori extensions are installed.
I also see from the screenshot that you have some other extensions installed as well.
It is possible that all of those extensions are not compatible with each other.
Can you please provide me with the actual dev space that was used and the full list of extensions used for the workspace.
This should allow me to get closer to replicating the issue you are having.
Please screen shot the full list of extensions, scrolling and multiple screen shots may be required to capture the full list.
See the attached dev-spaces-view image and a capture example full-extensions-list.

Best regards,

Hello , Please find the version info attached. Thanks,  2022-08-30 11:19:55 -  (I057368) (External Info)
Hi ,
This is something that should not normally occur.
The version of node in the terminal should have been updated automatically to version 16+
For the old dev space.
Please can you select the Extensions tab as indicated in attached image.
Collapse the other headings and only expend the built in heading.
And then screen shot/save the image and respond here.
The expected version number for the extensions '%annotation...' etc. are 1.7.1
This would confirm the exact version of the extensions that are running in your dev space.
I would at the moment suspect that the old dev space was created in a BAS development only mode, but I would like to confirm that.
Best regards,
.

N.B. yes the description and name are not showing correctly - we are aware of this minor display issue. 2022-08-30 09:02:50 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi , Usually we follow below steps 1.Start dev space a, open project a, preview project a.
2.Start dev space b, open project b, preview project b. We found a difference in the output behavior for existing space and new spaces where the npm dependency (npm i @sap/ux-ui5-tooling )and node version were different.. Old Space - Node  - 14.19.0 Tooling 1 New Space - Node  - 16.15.0 Tooling >1.5.0. Thanks, 
2022-08-29 09:16:59 -  (I057368) (External Info)
Hi ,
Development are unable to replicate the issue you have at this time.
I would ask you if you could provide more detail.
Specifically the steps you are following such as:
Start dev space a, open project a, preview project a, close preview, stop dev space. Start dev space b, open project b, preview project b, close preview, stop dev space.
What we are interested in is the reason why the system is using port 8081 (rather that port 8080 which would be the standard port to use), this is an indicator of the difference.
Please highlight any differences to the indicated scenario.
Best regards,
. 2022-08-25 12:15:31 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hello, I tried with shutting off one space ,while previewing in the other , it did not work. Please note that this issue started popping recently, we used to work with multiple spaces before and preview worked fine. Thanks,  2022-08-24 21:32:58 -  (I057368) (External Info)
Hi ,
Development are trying to understand your issue fully and replicate it.
Can you try the work around of stopping the the first dev space and then start the second (cloned) dev space.
I expect that if you do this that the preview will work for the second dev space.
Please confirm if this works for you.

(It is not explicitly stated in the information you provide, but the images indicate that the first preview and or the first dev space is still running when you attempt to preview for the second dev space because it is running on an allocated port of 8081 for the second one)

Hi,
Following the screen share meeting with the customer and @., we saw that we were able to access the destination by running a curl command in BAS terminal: curl http://NineTabOdata.dest This means there is no connectivity issue.
Also, we noticed the service metadata was in a JSON format instead of XML.
The Fiori Elements wizard identified this service as a Catalog service, even though it isn't.
CA-UX-IDE colleagues, please continue to investigate this issue. Also, please make sure that before passing any similar tickets to BAS, you have asked the customer to send the response to the curl command stated above to eliminate the option of a connectivity issue.
Please let us know if there is any further action needed from our side.

Hello  /Colleagues on support,
At this point, we will have to rely on your (or your team's) expertise to sort out the latest reply from the customer:
"BAS doesn't successfully authenticate with it at all to list the services and the check destination function fails. If you want to schedule a time to screen share on Monday, I would be happy to show you."

For Fiori tools side, it would have been great if some information as mentioned here is provided:
https://wiki.wdf.sap.corp/wiki/display/webapptoolkit/BAS+Connectivity+Troubleshooting#BASConnectivityTroubleshooting-RequiredInformationfromCustomer-forAccessingODataServiceDuringProjectGeneration

We are more than happy to help here (if its needed), but we need your help to get past the connectivity issues first.
If we are able to get into a meeting (preferably with the customer), that should also help us identify the core problem. Customer has already offered to be available for a meeting, so lets use that.
If needed, from Fiori tools side, please do not hesitate to contact me or @ (*SAP-ID*)
Since this message has gone through multiple components, as a next step, I would highly recommend that a meeting be arranged with the customer. FYI @ (*SAP-ID*)

Ive udpated the business impacted  (business impact section). Please see below


Test / Development System / Project: 

------------------------------------ 

Since when is the problem occurring? Originally reported in April

Which project phase are you currently in?  We’re preparing for Final End user Acceptance Testing

Is the project at a standstill? Yes, only workflows can be tested without storage of any results

Are there any external consultants involved? How many? Yes - four

Is the project plan delayed? By how much is it delayed? The delay is only due to this issue, and therefore without resolution, indefinitely.

Are there any milestones / deadlines coming up? When? UAT, GO-Live

Is a Go Live date scheduled? When?  Originally scheduled for 6/28

Is the problem a show stopper? Without resolution it will cause a complete rewrite of the application

What are the consequences if the deadline / Go Live cannot be met? We are at risk of not being able to demonstrate a workflow/system that will enable us to readily audit our DOD Procurement process.  Audiors will be on premise in July.

Are there any financial losses for you? Can the financial value be assessed in dollar terms? Significant withholdings from our government billings.

Dear Customer,
From what I can see in the attached screenshots. It seems that you are using your own S-user or S-user associated e-mail address as the "OAuth2Password" user.
It is required to use technical user in the destination configuration instead of your own user. Please find more details below which is in the help portal.
Caution
Do not use your own personal credentials in the and fields. Always use a technical user instead.
Could you please try to use the technical user and try again?
Thank you

Hi, Sorry I didn't pick up the phone, I am not used to getting valid phone calls from those countries. The blog you posted doesn't help because we cannot browse services in that way using the destination. BAS doesn't successfully authenticate with it at all to list the services and the check destination function fails. If you want to schedule a time to screen share on Monday, I would be happy to show you. I also attached screenshots of everything we've tried in this incident. Thanks,  2021-06-27 07:31:16 -  (I530573) (Internal Info)
Hi colleagues, By investigating our system logs we didn't find any relevant errors so we don't think the issue relates to BAS connectivity but more of a usage issue. Since you own this template (SAPUI5 freestyle) please advise what is the expected destination configuration in order to consume this kind of OData service from your templates. If you don't find anything wrong with the customer's configuration let us know how we can assist. If we won't be able to determine the root cause we will arrange a meeting with the relevant colleagues to resolve this issue.

Hello, Please excuse the delay in response. I was waiting on the customer to provide the necessary information. Please see requested information below.

What's the Production GL date？
6/28/21
How many end users will be affected?
10-20
What's the finanacial impact if there is delay of Prod system GL?
The financial impact of not meeting the implementation date is indirect as this application is a compliance application to ensure all pertinent criterion are met before moving forward with purchase.  Without the application there is risk associated with the process and that risk could bear escalating fines and exclusion from program award selection.    Additionally, Payment withholds affecting cash flow under DFARS Business System Rules; either 5% up to 10% for serious deficiencies in multiple contractor business systems

Dear customer,
By viewing the attached destination "NineTabOdata.zip" I noticed the destination is missing the HTML5.DynamicDestination: true property under "Additional Properties". Property Name: HTML5.DynamicDestination. Value: true.
This property allows the approuter to list the destinations in BAS.
Please try adding it and see if the issue persists.

Hi , We've actually done that successfully already (see past screenshots and messages). We need help consuming the service from an SAPUI5 application in BAS. Thanks,  2021-06-17 10:38:23 -  (I069548) (External Info)
Hi ,
This is how you can call your destination:
Please see the attached "destination-sap-api-hub.docx", which contains screenshots.
Roughly the steps are:
1.  a token using the service key of any destination instance in your subaccount (in cockpit)
2. Use the generated in step 1 token to call the destination service rest from sap api hub
3. Use the token returned from the destination service rest to call the URL inside your destination.

Hi ,
During export client secret and password are not exported for security reasons.
The attached destination does not contain those.
If you decide you can provide the client secret and password as well so I can check the destination.
Or I can guide you how to check it yourself, if you prefer so.
Regards,
. 2021-06-15 15:57:31 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
OK. I uploaded a zip file with the exported destination. Yes, I do not know how to consume this type of destination, it doesn't work like the other destinations (like an ecc service). I need specific advice for this type. 2021-06-15 08:06:13 -  (I069548) (External Info)
Hi ,
Let's summarize: You have "NineTabOauth"  destination with authentication OAuth2Password which does not work from your html 5 app. But from  the request to the odata service works.
If this is the case from my PoV either the destination does not  proper token or the html 5 runtime(not your app) does not use the destination properly.
Is it an option for you to export the NineTabOauth  destination from the cockpit and also provide the user/pass  and clientid/client secret so I can try to call the odata system and check if the destination generates proper token?
If the token is fine I'll forward the ticket to the html5 team, the destination looks ok from my PoV.
Regards,
. 2021-06-14 18:29:40 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi , The service clearly does not work the same way as standard odata services (like on-premise or northwind). I need specific documentation that tells me how to connect to this hana cloud odata service. The documents you sent refer to the regular odata services which we have no issue connecting to. Can you please give me steps and code that will help me connect my sapui5 application to this hana cloud odata service? If you think it's very simple, I'd be happy to share my screen with you. Or maybe you could try to repeat the exact scenario and share the code? Thanks,  2021-06-13 11:34:51 -  (I310771) (External Info)
Dear Customer,
I am sorry for the misunderstanding. For sapui5 applicaitons you could use the Approuter and easily consume your destination.
Here are several blogs that will help you configure your scenario:
https://blogs.sap.com/2020/04/03/sap-application-router/ Check out "Destinations and Integration with Destination Service" https://blogs.sap.com/2021/01/28/creating-a-sample-sapui5-application-with-destination-in-cloud-foundry-environment/ https://blogs.sap.com/2020/08/23/how-to-consume-destinations-in-sap-cloud-platform-cloud-foundry/
Best regards,
 2021-06-12 17:05:29 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
OK, but we don't have a java application we have a sapui5 application. Do we really have to do curl commands? Why can't this be consumed like other odata services in sapui5? Do you have documentation on how to do it from sapui5 instead of us trying to figure out how to translate it? 2021-06-12 16:19:09 -  (I310771) (External Info)
Dear ,
The Destination service works as expected for your destination. It fetches the OAuth token that you need to access the URL configured in your destination. The same thing that you did with  (the same two requests) could be implemented to be done via your java application. Here it is documented how to consume the Destination Service from an application: https://help.sap.com/viewer/cca91383641e40ffbe03bdc78f00f681/Cloud/en-US/7e306250e08340f89d6c103e28840f30.html
All you need is a destination service instance that has a binding to you app and then you could use the FIND api to retrieve your destination. Then using the OAuth token from the response, you could configure your request to the target system and consume the destination.
Best regards,
 2021-06-11 18:00:59 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi , We are able to successfully get data from the service with the 2 requests. I attached 2 screenshots to show it. I don't see what that proves for us though, because we need to consume it through the destination. If you think the destination is working and the check connection button is just useless, please provide the steps to successfully consume it in our app. I've tried every example I can find documentation for without success. For instance, here is one that doesn't work and returns a 401 Unauthorized error: https://blogs.sap.com/2020/07/08/show-data-from-a-hana-cloud-odata-service-in-a-fiori-html5-table/?update=publish Thanks,  2021-06-11 06:59:39 -  (I310771) (External Info)
Hi ,
You need to navigate to your destination service instance and see the credentials that are provided in the service key. If you don't have a service key, just create one.
In the service key you will find the token service url and the clientId and clientSecret. In the screenshots provided here I could see that you are not using proper credentials.
First you need to execute a POST request to the OAuth token service in order to get a token using grant_type: client_credentials. Then when you retrieve this token. You could execute the get request to the Destination Service using OAuth2.0 with Header prefix  and pass there in the Access Token field the token that you just retrieved.
Here in your requests I think that only the clientId and Secret are wrong. When you get the proper one from the Destination Service instance, you will be able to get the destination.
You could check this documentation as well: https://help.sap.com/viewer/cca91383641e40ffbe03bdc78f00f681/Cloud/en-US/83a3f3b9cd314618aba651044ed5b9df.html
it explains what is informations holds the response that will be returned.

Dear Customer,
Please, have in mind that the check connection button is just a functionality provided for testing purposes. In CF there are a lot of supported authentication types. If you are not using destination and try to execute request to your target server via  what kind of Authentication flow do you use? If you answer yourself to this question, you will be able to select the proper Authentication type for your destination.
In order to isolate the issue please use the Destination Service REST API: https://api.sap.com/api/SAP_CP_CF_Connectivity_Destination/resource
And execute a "Find a destination by name on all levels and return the first match" request. Then the Destination Service will try to execute the authentication flow that you have configured and will return you a valid OAuth token (if you are using OAuth). When you retrieve the destination and the token from the Destination Service then you should be able to use this token to access the target URL that you have configured in the Destination.
By executing these steps we will be able to isolate the issue and understand if it is within the Destination Service or within BAS.

Dear Development team, I hope you're all doing well. This customer is not being able to consume their OData Services in their application via SAP WebIDE. If they try choosing the destination within the data sources in WebIDE, the destination does not show up; If they try consuming the Odata Services as per described in https://blogs.sap.com/2020/07/08/show-data-from-a-hana-cloud-odata-service-in-a-fiori-html5-table/?update=publish they get an 404 error. (I was able to reproduce the issue when trying to consume Northwind Odata Services by referring to this) Due to the expired MPT and deadline impacting customer, could you please assist on this? Best regards,  SAP BTP Core Product Support 2021-05-30 20:18:50 -  (I530726) (External Info)
Hi , I'm involving our development team to assist with this. Please, expect an update within the next business days. In the meanwhile, could you please clarify which template from "New Project from Template" you are selecting when trying to consume the OData service? Best regards,  SAP BTP Core Product Support 2021-05-28 19:59:06 -  (I530726) (External Info)
Hi , Thank you for the update and also thank you for sharing the documentation you used to try to consume the OData services. I'm going to recreate the scenario at my side and update you in the next business day. Best regards,  SAP BTP Core Product Support 2021-05-28 15:52:18 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi , OK, I'm not sure the value of the "Check Connection" if it gives an error message whether it's working or not. The destination does not appear in the list of available data sources when creating a new project from template, so I can't browse the service. I tried adding it to an existing application following this blog and it provides a 404 error. https://blogs.sap.com/2020/07/08/show-data-from-a-hana-cloud-odata-service-in-a-fiori-html5-table/?update=publish Can you please provide details on how to add and consume this service? If you want to get together on a screen share, I would be happy to meet today. Thanks,  2021-05-27 22:10:33 -  (I530726) (External Info)
Hi , Thank you for the update. I discussed about this with colleagues and they informed the some services may return 401 when performing the "Check Connection" via the destination but this can be due to the way the credentials are being passed in the connection check. This does not necessarily mean the destination is not working. But, if the Destination returned the response "Backend Status could not be determined", then we could guarantee it is not working. As next steps: 1-Could you please check if the application is able to get data from the backend? 2- If the application is not able to get data from the OData destination, please, let me know how the destination is being pointed for the Application to get data from it? 3- Also, please, let me know what happens when trying to get data from the Destination.
Best regards,  SAP BTP Core Product Support 2021-05-27 16:03:22 -  (I530726) (External Info)
Hi , Thank you for the information. I'm checking this and you can expect me to update you in the next hours. Best regards,  SAP BTP Core Product Support 2021-05-26 15:59:03 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi , 1. It was created in BAS. 2. There's no Odata service to consume because the destination doesn't work at all. 3. It does not work, I've attached another screenshot, but the screenshots already attached show the same if you want to check those. 2021-05-26 00:47:44 -  (I530726) (External Info)
Hi , I apologize for the delay. I'm highlighting this incident so this is my main priority at the moment and you can expect very frequent updates from now on.
Next steps:
Is this an application developed in Business Application Studio or WebIDE? What happens when you try to consume the Odata services directly from the application?
Please, provide me with a step by step documentation with screenshots showing this.
Also, could you please create a new destination with authentication method "OAuth2ClientCredentials" as per https://help.sap.com/viewer/b865ed651e414196b39f8922db2122c7/Cloud/en-US/7aefa21a65f94b25b7e639c3931b6f83.html
Then try consuming the Odata Services in the application using this "OAuth2ClientCredentials" destination.

I added some screenshots to show more specifics of the issue. We generated the service using the Yeoman saphanaacademy-odata generator and it is successfully created and deployed. The service is reachable using OAuth password grant type in  (request utility application), and returns data. But using the same grant type and auth info in the cloud destination results in a 401 Unauthorized error. I've noticed in  that the request sends the auth data in headers by default, but if I change it to send the auth data in the url, it gives a 401. I'm thinking that maybe the cloud destination is sending its auth data in the url, rather than headers, and that's why it's giving 401. Is there a way to force the destination to send the auth data in headers instead, so maybe it will work? Thank you for your help. If you'd like to set up a screen share so we can show you, that would be very helpful.

Hi, If ABAP on Premise is selected, then you are requested to provide a URL for the mandatory field "System URL" plus the optional field "SAP Client (leave empty for default)". If the System URL requires credentials then two mandatory fields are displayed 'Service username' and 'Service password'. When valid credentials are entered, then login has taken place. For example, internally, we have an ABAP On Premise test system that we can only access internally e.g. https://test-sys-abap.wdf.sap.corp:44300/ which also requires a specific client ID. The user in this scenario is required to have this sap client ID assigned to their profile. Please refer to https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sap/generator-fiori and search for `Connect to a System`.

Hi,
If possible, can you please try to deploy again with the flag `abap-deploy –log-level=error` appended. This might give a better reason why the backend is failing?
This link has some manual steps that might help troubleshoot your issue https://blogs.sap.com/2020/10/29/develop-deploy-sapui5-fiori-like-app-using-sap-business-application-studio-bas-and-troubleshooting/

Another interesting link where HTTP 500 error is due to the misalignment of the ui5 version?
If this does not help then I will try to involve the abap-deploy team to assit with your issue.
 2021-06-11 10:13:04 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi ,
Sorry, have been pre-occupied lately. 1. Ok 2. The backend is the same. abap-deploy only throws errors the first time - it deploys in 'update' mode afterwards. However, the npr deploy does not work for the same backend. 3. No - the successful deployment shows up in the logs, but there is no node visible in sicf and nothing in the TR 4. Ok, will follow that in the next deployment 5. Will look at it. 2021-06-06 23:16:21 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
I'm a developer on the Sap Fiori team and I'm hoping I can help. First off, my apologies, this is happening.
To clarify some of your points;
1. Yes, we 100% agree that the configuration steps required to enable the user/pass for deployment are not detailed enough. This is an item that is currently being addressed and our help guides are being worked on. We are also trying to make the user experience better, so that additional prompts are provided during the deployment to support adding a user/pass.
2. I have not seen HTTP 500's before during deployment, this error would normally mean the specified backend is throwing an unknown exception. Can you confirm if the same backends are throwing the error 500 when using abap-deploy? Are there any proxy issues? Are you able to view the app in local preview mode i.e. right click your app and select preview application?
3. On your attached word doc, there is a successful deployment. Are you able to view this app, opening the URL in your browser? If not, what errors do you receive in your browser developer tools network and/or console tab?
4. This is a detailed tutorial of deploying to ABAP using our tooling https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/abap-environment-deploy-cf-production.html#4866d917-8fe7-4ef5-9910-7cd33ff42a2f - step 7 is important, how to verify if the app is deployed, please ignore the Launchpad information if not applicable to you.
5. Another good tutorial is https://blogs.sap.com/2020/08/10/sap-fiori-tools-deploy-to-abap-server/ which has some good discusson points around issues with deployment i.e. auth and client parameters, are these required for your setup?
Please let me know how you get on?
 2021-06-04 08:15:56 -  (D022159) (External Info)
Thanks for the explanations! I will now involve an expert of the (npm run) deploy function for further support. 2021-06-03 09:59:23 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi , The story so far,
Initially we used abap-deploy to deploy the apps, but we had a lot of issues with that until we managed to get a working solution, or at least disregard the deployment errors that show up in the log the first time. The abap-deploy as we now understand works in 'update' mode. Now, before we understood that abap-deploy works in an 'update' mode, we raised this OSS and were told that we have to use npm run deploy instead of abap-deploy So, we tried running npm-run-deploy and had issues deploying as described in the document that is attached and my explanation. We struggled and had to do a lot of research to get past issues, like create a .env file for credentials, replace destination url with target system url in the ui5-deploy.yaml file. Now, the issue with npm run deploy is that if we use https://da1-web.ecdomain.net, the deploy log states that deployment succeeded, but there is no node in SICF (basically it does not deploy). And if we use http://da1-web.ecdomain.net for deployment, it does not work. And various combinations of http://da1-web.ecdomain.net with http/https, 443/8080 have been used. The point is - the Help document links given in the OSS do not even  mention that we have to change the target from destination to target system url, but it is a struggle from that point onward to figure out the mixed messages deployment log provides and the inability to deploy the app. In this context, we reverted back to abap-deploy (something that works better than nothing that works) But we need to understand what is the correct way and if npm run deploy is the correct way, why does it not work
Regards,
 2021-06-02 13:00:56 -  (D022159) (External Info)
Further question: The latest word doc shows the app being deployed correctly. Did you then switch the destination, or use another tool than  abap-deploy? 2021-06-02 09:26:45 -  (D022159) (External Info)
, From the given attachments the situation is not completely clear: you have added a longer docs where everything seems to work fine. The Parse-Error attachment shows an exception when executing abap-deploy. And then there is  Deploy_Error.PNG which also show an exception but also some hints. Did you follow these hints? If you need further support: am I right that the problem is about the abap-deploy step? Best regards,   2021-06-02 09:20:17 -  (D022159) (External Info)
Hello , 2021-06-01 15:00:03 -  (I074055) (External Info)
Hi 

I'm passing the incident over to CA-UX-IDE as it is a different support team for npm deploy from Fiori tools.

best regards,


2021-06-01 15:00:03 -  (I074055) (Internal Info)
Hi Colleagues

As per recent advice from the Business application studio dev team, I've advised the customer to use npm deploy from Fiori tools in BAS to deploy their UI5 Adaption project. Given docs:
https://help.sap.com/viewer/17d50220bcd848aa854c9c182d65b699/Latest/en-US/1b7a3be8d99c45aead90528ef472af37.html https://help.sap.com/viewer/17d50220bcd848aa854c9c182d65b699/Latest/en-US/607014e278d941fda4440f92f4a324a6.html
Customer has had various issues with the tool. See their reply right below. They've gone back to using abap-deploy which is not what the BAS team want. It is too buggy and even the customer knows this but they seem to have too many issues with npm deploy. Possibly there is some gap in the documentation as the customer appears to be suggesting.

best regards
 2021-06-01 13:58:09 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi , I tried to follow the documentation you provided in the links for npm deploy. The steps were as follows, 1. Create Deploy Config using npx fiori deploy config 2. npm run build (optional) 3. npm run deploy #1 - I managed to create a deploy config. I ran into an issue earlier, but then once I ran the command from the root folder, it succeeded. #2 - I did not run the npm run build command as the documentation simply states running the npm run build command directly. #3 - Next, was npm run deploy and here I faced a lot of issues. I spent pretty much entire day before I made some changes after referring to some blogs and managing to work around some issues. - The ui5-deploy.yaml file created in step #1 had the destination and its url in the target section without any section for credentials etc. So, the first issue I got was was the deployment log stating that incorrect credentials were provided. After performing some research I created .env file (which should be placed in the root folder and not in webapp ... some more research) to hold my user name and password for the target system. Still the deployment failed. - Upon further research, I changed the target details to include directly the hostname and port of the target system instead of the destination details. For this, deployment to https://da1-web.ecdomain.net:443 always showed as successful, but no node would be visible in the target system 'sicf'. If I deployed to https://da1-web.ecdomain.net:8080 (this is incidently the url which is opened for any other sicf service under ui5_ui5 node), the deployment fails.
So, we are back to using abap-deploy for now - it is buggy but we manage to get something done. With npm run deploy, we haven't managed much success. Screenshots are attached in deploy-to-abap.docx
Regards,
 I have attached screenshots of my activities Regards,  2021-05-26 15:03:10 -  (I074055) (External Info)
Hi 

Npm deploy is from Fiori tools which is a predefined extension. Adaption projects is another extension. The dev space must be either of type fiori or full stack to have fiori tools. There's no adaption project dev space type so it isn't really relevant for npm deploy.
As  as the dev space type is either either fiori or full stack you will have the fiori tools extension and be able to use npm deploy. Adaption projects extensions can also be used with those dev space types.

best regards,

2021-05-26 14:18:31 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi , Just one more question - is this deployment method also applicable for Adaptation Projects? Or do we continue to use Yeoman generator based deployment for Adaptation Projects. Regards,
 2021-05-26 13:16:54 -  (I074055) (External Info)
HI 

Sure. Fiori tools are there by default if the dev space is either type Fiori or Full stack. Just use the BAS terminal for the deploy command.

Hi

Yes sorry my mistake. The BAS deploy method abap-deploy is no longer in maintenance and has issues. It should not be used.
The preferred method to deploy to ABAP from BAS is 'npm run deploy' command in the BAS terminal.
See Deployment
and
Deploy an Application

'npm run deploy' is part of the Fiori tools on Cloud Foundry BAS.

Hi

Can you access wed ide with the debug url and reproduce the parse error.
Add ?sap-ide-debug=true parameter to the URL of your Web IDE. Reproduce the error and provide:
the console log of Chrome and the network trace (see note 1990706 on how to get the network trace). web ide service logs. Go to subaccount cockpit > services > SAP Web IDE Full-Stack > logs

Hi team,

We have created a SAP UI5 transactional app developed in SAP Business Application Studio (SAP Fiori template, not Adaptation Project) and I am trying to deploy it to my on-premise SAP S/4HANA 1909 FPS02 system with embedded FES i.e. DA1 Client 100
My cloud connector resources has all paths & sub paths enabled and my destination has the following properties (in image below, WebIDEUsage = dev_abap is present) with Authentication = NoAuthentication. (image attached)

Destination used - BusinessApplicationStudio (devs4da1:443)
On using the deployment procedure mentioned in link I get the following error (image attached).

Funny thing is, in my transport (image attached) on DA1 100 (the one I use during deployment), I see some objects being captured and the UI5 app (even in SE80, I see some details in the package), but when I go to SICF, I do not see the node of my SAP UI5 application.
What could be the possible issue here - considering my destination has all the properties and the cloud connector is allowing all sub-paths. Apparently, only a partial deployment is occurring (ABAP_REPOSITORY_SRV is maintained as well)

Regards,

HI ,
Might be a repeated question, so apologies for that, but I need to clarify. So you are trying to create a Fiori app using ODATA v2 or v4 service?
Regards,
 2022-12-13 03:04:05 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hello , The backend system is a SAP Solution Manager system, so I am not sure if it supports odata v4 yet.
Thank you!  2022-12-12 22:48:43 -  (I829208) (External Info)
Hi ,

- Can you please confirm if the V4 service /sap/opu/odata4 is exposed. Please refer to following blog:https://blogs.sap.com/2020/10/12/odata-v4-service-catalog/ - Some addtional handy information on publishing v4 group pf services is here: https://help.sap.com/docs/ABAP_PLATFORM_NEW/a602ff71a47c441bb3000504ec938fea/f188a5ae7723424cabafbf3c80ce0c17.html?version=201809.latest

- Fallback: If you have the full service URL, then in the generator you can choose the source "Connect to an OData service" and proceed with your project generation. And in meantime, we will work with you finding the root cause of adding a new system error.

Regards,

Hi , Does this mean that Fiori elements support only odata v4, and since the backend system I am developing for only support odata v2, it fails to generate using fiori elements? I tried using fiori freestyle for the same backend system and it works just fine. Thank you!  2022-12-11 09:09:00 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hello , Going back to the original problem. I have attached the output of the debug logs.  Please see attachment. Kindly help me analyze why it is failing to create the link to the system. Thank you!  2022-12-11 08:58:46 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hello , Just thought of sharing.  I solved the problem of the generator not running by reinstalling nodeJS on the development machine. It would not be a very bad idea, in the future, to incorporate checks in the launch of the generator to see if the components it needs from nodeJS is corrupted or not.  As it is now, there are no messages, no warnings, no errors at all.  The feedback mechanism would be really good to have so as to avoid having the developer check lots of things that might not be related to the root cause itself. Thank you!  2022-12-10 07:59:46 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hello , I tried spinning up a virtual machine (from Windows Sandbox) and did a fresh installation of VSCode (with sync settings off) and installed the Fiori extensions.  All the same problem.  The generator won't start anymore. Thank you!  2022-12-10 07:43:58 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hello , I followed the steps in How to uninstall VS Code completely? - deBUG.to to cleanup vscode completely.  After doing that I did a fresh installation of VSCode and Fiori tools. Still the same.  The Fiori App generator won't start anymore.  I suspect the issue might be related to the 01 December release update of Fiori-Tools. Thank you!  2022-12-10 07:06:35 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hello , I noticed that there was an update delivered on 01 December.  I upgraded the extensions to this version, and it seems it made the problem worse. Now, the application generator does not start at all. Please see the attachment for steps to reproduce. Thank you!  2022-12-02 15:47:15 -  (I012956) (External Info)
Hi ,
Thanks for the detailed response, and good/interesting to see that adding the system via the panel worked. Can you also confirm that the Fiori Elements flow is now fully working or at least you can get past the data source step? Further to this, I'd like to get some additional logs to help us understand what was happening here as the error doesnt seem consistent between both places so we would like to check this.
The steps I provided for logs previously should give slightly different output that you provided, and should log each step of the system connection calls. I've attached a screenshot of the output tab for where the logs I'm referring to should be. If you get a chance, would you be able to try recreate the reported issue and copy the logs here if possible? You would need to delete the system from your saved systems, this could be done from the same panel were you added it. This would help us understand why its failing in the FE generator flow but not in the others. I appreciate this extra effort on your side so if you get a chance to do this it would be help us a lot.
Kind regards,

The Fiori tools team

Hello , Please see information below: 1.  Yes, it is fully accessible on the browser.  I tried using Edge and Chrome, both to be very sure.  Furthermore, I tried also using  command to be very sure also that the endpoint is really accessible, and the problem appears to be isolated to VSCode.  In particular, the problem appears to be isolated to creating a new system and appears to be isolated to an Elements application.  If I try via freestyle, I encounter no issues at all. 2.  No, it does not require any configuration on end-user's end, hence, transparent proxy.  This way, even applications that does not have options for proxy configuration will not run into issues. 3.  Tried the troubleshooting steps you provided and got this error from the console. The termination occurred in system   with error code 404 and for the reason Not found. What can I do? Please select a valid URL.

Thank you!  2022-12-02 11:39:51 -  (I012956) (External Info)
Hi ,

Thanks for the providing the video of steps taken. There are some things we can check and information I need:
- can you confirm that the system/url you are trying to access is accessible in your browser? You mentioned your proxy setup, does that require any special config on your end? VSCode will pick up environmental variables for proxy config if none are set in VSCode.
- can you follow these steps to add more debug logs and attach here if possible:
In VSCode, choose File → Preferences → Open Preferences Search for 'wizard' in the Search Preferences box. Under Application Wizard: Logging Level, change the dropdown box to be 'debug' Close the Preferences window. Re-launch the generator. Choose View → Output and choose the log for either Application.Templates or Application.Generators
Re-run the steps in the generator and please provide the full output log here.
- One additional thing to check (likely the same result): can you try to add the system from SAP Fiori extension on the activity bar on the left window? This should be the same flow as before, but will rule out any issue specifically in the generator.

Kind regards,

If it is necessary to do this in a production environment, SAP Support will contact me specifically before proceeding. --- Description --- Hi SAP. We have just setup Business Application Studio to develop UI5 applications for our OnPremise S/4HANA system. I have used the template to create a test application, that displays a simple list which content is served by an OData service in the backend. I am testing the app locally from Business Application Studio. I can connect fine, and in /IWFND/TRACES I can see my OData requests. However all Querys (called via $batch) are rejected due to a "CSRF token validation error". I do see "HEAD" operation calls being made, that retrieves valid CSRF token in the http header, and this token is passed by the client on subsequent $batch calls. However the $batch calls are all rejected. I refer you to this post, which has exactly the same problem:
https://answers.sap.com/questions/13096265/csrf-token-issues-with-batch-in-business-applicati.html I have also attached the http header extract for the $batch call. There are many header values, and I suspect it could be related to these. I hope you can help.

For issue 1 in previous post: We are using URL rewrites due to backend using SAML. Everything under '/sap' uses SAML, while '/odata' uses Basic Auth. I have uploaded picture that shows needed config in UI5.yaml file for URL rewrite. Note: Please note that the value of 'pathPrefix' has an extra slash in the end. Calls are failing if this is not in place. This is definitely an error. Thanks,   2021-06-01 15:28:02 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi. I have just had a session with  , and we had the following findings: 1. URL rewrites are not fully working. 2. The CSRF token issue is only triggered from the new BAS Templates. For now I will focus on the last one as this is the most important. We have tried creating a baseline Ui5 application - one using the new template and the other using the old (deprecated) one. The old one is working but the new template is not. I am uploading http header file from the ABAP trace for the working and non-working scenario. Furthermore a screendump from a file comparison tool which displays the differences. Best regards,   2021-06-01 13:54:41 -  (I540903) (External Info)

 2022-08-21 22:04:48 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hello, When I reported this issue on 14 August 2022, the extensions are on version 1.7.0. As of 19 August 2022, version 1.7.1 has been released.  I upgraded to this version of the extensions and confirmed that now, applications generated via the App Generator are now fully working as expected. I looked at the change logs for 1.7.1 but this adjustment to the registry is nowhere to be found. I can only imagine that the fix was included in this release but was simply not included in the change log for being quite basic. Nonetheless, I am happy that it is now working without issues.

2022-08-16 14:14:01 -  (C5226337) (External Info)
Dear Customer,

You can open the terminal from the VSCode and run "npm config list" which will list all the npm configuration parameters and where they are defined.

Search for any entry that starts with "@sap/registry" and remove them the respective files.

If there are no such entries or the issue still persists please attach the output of the "npm config list" and error log from the "npm install" command.

Regards,
The Fiori tools team 2022-08-16 13:57:51 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hello, Yes, that's correct.  "npm install" also fails. May I ask the location of the .npmrc file so I can adjust it accordingly. Meanwhile, are you also making the adjustments to the vscode extensions to point to the new path? Thank you!  2022-08-16 13:43:09 -  (C5226337) (External Info)
Dear Customer,

Is this also the case for you that "npm install" fails?

If that is the case then please check and make sure that in .npmrc file the registry for @sap is not set to the deprecated url and is using https://registry.npmjs.org instead.

Regards,
The Fiori tools team 2022-08-16 13:07:14 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hello Team, Yes, I think your findings are correct.  If you look at the github issue I shared earlier, looks like the rootcause is related to @sap registry no longer existing but the generator still picks it up and points to the wrong path.  This is the reason why "npm install" fails to load all the modules, and ultimately leads to this error. Thank you!  2022-08-16 07:24:20 -  (C5226337) (External Info)

Dear Customer,

We were able to reproduce the issue on our side only if we explicitly deleted files from "node_modules/.bin" folder. This lead us to believe that somehow the "npm install" command did not complete successfully or node_modules somehow got corrupted. Could you please try deleting the "node_modules" folder from the project and running "npm install" for the project again?

If the issue still persist then please provide the following information:

1. List of effective npm configuration parameters. You can get it by running command "npm config list"
2. Are executable files for "fiori" command present in "node_modules/.bin" folder?

Regards,

Dear Customer
I'm from BAS core team,
From checking the BAS backend logs and the attachment envcheck-2022-07-18T11-06-01.zip the error is return from the target destination system (my313797_SAML_ASSERTION).
Do you have any other way to check the request for
/sap/opu/odata/IWFND/CATALOGSERVICE;v=2/ServiceCollection/?$top=1
works outside of BAS?
Thanks and best regards Roy

Hi ,

I have reviewed the attachment with my team, based on this we are forwarding this case to CA-BAS-AUT as there looks to be an authorisation issue which they can support with.

Kind regards,

Hi , Sending you the Environment check file for your reference. I was referring the URL path maintained in the Destination. If i configure based on a odata service URL it is working correct. However, if I give API URL it is throwing error (for which i attached the Environment check log) Regards  2022-07-18 22:22:12 -  O' (I012956) (External Info)
Hi ,
The Guided Answers link details steps for using Environment check. You should be able to run this to analyse the destination config, in your case for s4 cloud destination, and get a report with solutions suggested if possible.
Could you clarify what url section you refer to, is this the odata service url input in the Application Generator? And if so that entering the odata url here works correctly?
Regards,
 2022-07-18 13:19:23 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
HI , I understand from the Guided answers the connection process i have followed is for On premise S4HANA In case of S4HANA cloud in the URL section if i give the ODATA URL form the Connection arrangement it is working. Confirm if my understanding is correct. Regards  2022-07-18 10:27:15 -  O' (I012956) (External Info)

FLP is not the correct component.
Checked with colleagues from BAS team (CA-BAS-AUT), suggested the correct component of this case should be CA-UX-IDE. 3063160 - All catalog service requests failed for system: /. OData version(s): V2, V4. It is required to refer to the attachment in the KBA

Product Area selected: SAP Business Application Studio Component selected (Manual Selection): CA-UX-IDE --- Steps to Reproduce --- NOTE TO SAP SUPPORT: I give my approval for SAP Support to reproduce the issue described, while connected to my impacted non-production environments, using any steps provided in the description below or provided later, even if the steps result in a change being made, until the issue is closed. --- Description --- Dear SAP Support, Currently there is an issue in Business Application Studio with the metadata sync via so called “Service Manager”:
https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_FIORI_tools/17d50220bcd848aa854c9c182d65b699/8182ff3b19574f038bd636b9991aa24e.html

In step 5 of “How to sync services” we receive a 503 error:
An unexpected error occurred, Request failed with status code 503.

I check settings, logs (in Cloud Connector and ABAP), notes and help documents but was not able to find something that fix this issue.
Do you have an idea what could cause this issue with the metadata sync? Do we maybe have to configure something in our backends first?

Best regards 
2022-06-15 13:28:50 -  (I305274) (External Info)
Hello Customer,

From the error message, it looks like the backend service that the service manager is trying to connect to is not available.  Can you please confirm that it is available?  For example, are you able to create a new Fiori project and use the same service without issue?

Best regards,

Hi , We are reducing the priority of the incident as the issue seems to be resolved. But, we will  keep this incident open for few more weeks and let you know if we need any further help. Regards,  2023-01-30 10:42:51 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Solution provided: Hi,
So each destination type is configured differently, OAuth2SAMLBeaerAssertion is configured with a COMMUSER who might have different privileges used when creating SAMLAssertion destination. Another reason for the local APIs not showing is they are not added to the OData Business V2 | V4 catalog enabled for your user. In some instances, these catalogs are for general purpose and will not have local API's appended to them thus using the partial/full_url destination configuration is the correct way to consume these services.
You may need to speak to the team managing the authentication to determine if the service(s) are/can be appended correctly to the OData Catalog.
However, you have validated the end to end flow is working, services are returned in both destinations.
These link(s) provide a deeper understanding around OData catalog requests but again may not be applicable to you depending on your setup;

I'm setting this to resolved for now as this is now a configuration issue rather than an issue with Fiori Tools. Please feel free to reach out if there is anything else you need.
 2023-01-27 13:28:00 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi ,
We created a new destination with OAuth2SAMLAssertion. With this destination we tried to reproduce the issue. When it asked for the service path we gave it as below.
/sap/opu/odata/sap/API_PURCHASEORDER_PROCESS_SRV/
Now we are able to access standard(Remote) APIs. But, we are unable to access Local APIs. With the destination we created with SAMLAssertion we are able to access Local APIs.
At present we are facing this issue now. Is the authentication type "OAuth2SAMLAssertion" not supported for Local APIs? Could you please have a check on the issue based on the above update. Please find the screen shots in the attached word document.
Regards,  2023-01-20 13:27:30 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
Thanks for running those commands. Based on the results, everything is working as expected i.e. the metadata and service information is being returned.
I can see the Fiori Tools is still failing when you appended the trailing forward slash. It might be worth trying the following samples;
/API_PURCHASEORDER_PROCESS_SRV/
/API_PURCHASEORDER_PROCESS_SRV
And seeing if they make a difference?
Please let me know the outcome.
Point 4 is not required now as you have validate the metadata is being returned correctly.

2023-01-20 10:08:20 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi , We will get back to you on point no.4 But, please find the updates in the attached word document for the remaining points. Regards,  2023-01-18 09:57:24 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi
I'm just following up on your current issue with access to the S4 endpoint; please refer to this Guided Answers link for more information around accessing catalog endpoints for S4 users;
https://ga.support.sap.com/dtp/viewer/index.html#/tree/3046/actions/45995:48363:53594:52803
There are a couple of things to note; 1. Your destination properties already contains a username and password so it should not be prompting you for them again unless they are entered incorrectly 2. To confirm your destination is configured correctly as a partial URL destination, open a new terminal window in BAS and run the following commands; curl -L "$H2O_URL/destinations/s4c-starter-api-test/API_PURCHASEORDER_PROCESS_SRV/" -vs > curl-partialurl-output.txt 2>&1 curl -L "$H2O_URL/destinations/s4c-starter-api-test/API_PURCHASEORDER_PROCESS_SRV/$metadata" -vs > curl-partialurl-metadata-output.txt 2>&1
These commands assume the destination properties as shown Destination in BTP.docx have not changed.
Please review the output of these files as they will indicate if there is an issue with the configuration, if an XML OData document is returned, then everything is configured correctly.
Please attach these txt files to the support ticket for further review.
3. When entering the service path API_PURCHASEORDER_PROCESS_SRV using the Fiori Tools wizard, please ensure you try appending a forward slash i.e. API_PURCHASEORDER_PROCESS_SRV/. In some instances, the ABAP backend will not serve a service unless there is a trailing slash.
4. If none of these steps resolve your issue, please try creating a dynamic destination link to independently validate your settings;
https://ga.support.sap.com/dtp/viewer/index.html#/tree/3046/actions/45995:48363:53594:52803:52804:51208
Please ensure you adhere to the Prerequisites for this step.
5. The curl command documented in BAS terminal.doc is not correct, you need to access the destination link as documented by Roy on 10/01 21:01;
Instead of curl -iv my400731-api.s4hana.cloud.sap/sap/opu/odata/sap/API_PURCHASEORDER_PROCESS_SRV/ you need to run either of the following as both do the same thing;
curl -L "$H2O_URL/destinations/s4c-starter-api-test/API_PURCHASEORDER_PROCESS_SRV/$metadata"curl -L "https://s4c-starter-api-test.dest/API_PURCHASEORDER_PROCESS_SRV/$metadata"
Please let me know the outcome of these stesp.

Hi,
Looking at BAS server logs , it seems the customer backend , defined in destination s4c-starter-api-test return 403.

[2023-01-12T11:28:57.406Z] "GET /destinations/s4c-starter-api-test/sap/opu/odata/sap/API_PURCHASEORDER_PROCESS_SRV/?saml2=disabled HTTP/1.1 TLSv1.2" 403 - via_upstream -"-" 0 6812 868 868 "-" "axios/0.26.0" "a240cd04-7a33-49a2-9f6e-dcad9d46d25d""secure-outbound-connectivity.webide-system" "127.0.0.1:5000" inbound|5000|| 127.0.0.1:46576 100.96.13.163:5000 100.96.3.107:43472 outbound_.80_._.secure-outbound-connectivity.webide-system.svc.cluster.local default

Hence the issue doesn't seems like a connectivity issue.
Can you assist customer with the required settings for his scenario, or find a more appropriate component?

There is an email thread on this incident initiated by BAS team. Some of the issues may be addressed in the upcoming hot fix that BAS plan to release today. Liat is also setting up a call with customer to review any remaining issues after the hot fix, with help from Ian and  in case any of the issue is related to Fiori tools. 2022-11-08 18:11:19 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hello , We did observe all these issues post the BAS upgrade. I have explained and shown this to SAP Spoc for Sanofi - . These issues are dependent and impacting the over development, so creating the individual messages will be difficult to track the errors. I have attached few more screenshots of the errors for your reference. Please check and advise on the same. Also we need to understand  the root cause why these errors have to come up now if the tool was working earlier. Regards,  2022-11-08 01:26:02 -  (I017462) (External Info)
Hi ,

We didn't receive any known issues similar as the ones listed in the problem description.

Product Area selected: SAP Fiori for SAP S/4HANA Component selected (Manual Selection): CA-UX-IDE --- Description --- Dear SAP-Team, we are facing the attached issue during vsc remote deployment. The connection test from the system store is working. The whole certificate chain is imported in windows cert store (Root, intermediate, system) I have attached the project as zip-file.
2022-09-02 08:55:16 -  (I057951) (External Info)
Dear Customer,
Hope the documentation mentioned below from my colleague to add your certificate worked for you.
Please let us know if you need further support.
Regards,
 2022-08-25 14:39:14 -  (I830561) (External Info)
Dear customer,
I am glad the workaround works for you. The proper fix would require your corporate certificate to be included to the node.js runtime. So the node.js http client will trust the certificate. Please check if this documentation helps. Basically you need to add the file path of the downloaded certificate to node.js environment variable NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS. https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_FIORI_tools/17d50220bcd848aa854c9c182d65b699/4b318bede7eb4021a8be385c46c74045.html 2022-08-25 06:53:27 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Dear SAP-Team, this workaround works, but for us this is only workaround. The self-signed certificate comes from our enterprise/corporate CA and is trusted on every company device. Its not a total locally self signed certificate. On the Internet are a more customers like us who are getting this error. I think you should allow self signed certificates on enterprise level. Thanks, Regards  2022-08-24 00:59:28 -  (I830561) (External Info)
Dear customer,
The error you got at console "unable to get local issuer certificate" indicates your system is using self-signed certificate for https connection. We do support configuration to allow connect to system with self signed certificate. You can update your ui5-deploy.yaml by adding "ignoreCertError: true" under the configuration section. After update, this section in ui5-deploy.yaml should look like this:

configuration:
ignoreCertError: true

Hi ,
As talked in the chat session, the issue is the OData service is not accessible currently (i.e. you are not able to access it by opening it directly on your browser due to logon/credentials issue).
Please check it with your basis team to fix the issue first. In case you are still facing any further problems on the ui5 development tool after the logon/credentials issue has been solved, please feel free to update this case and I will involve the relevant team to assist you further.

Hi , I agree that switching to HTTPS is not so easy. But as browsers destain http with each version, in the nead future this will be unavoidable. I will try to nail down where the policy comes from, as from my understanding it does not come from our IT department. But two suggestions to mitigate this: - You should document this problem and its necessary solution on the browser side to not use HSTS/automatic HTTPS upgrade - The ADT prompt has the option to get a copy of the URL, however the VSC Fiori Tools Template Wizard does not have such an option but automatically opens the default browser. Please add also there an option to just copy the URL. Thanks,  2021-03-03 16:29:39 -  (I830561) (External Info)
Hi , I understand the inconvenience caused on you. However supporting https out of box is outside our scope. It will require us to ship both the certificate (public key) and private key. There is no protection any more since private key is exposed. In addition, browser displays warnings for self-signed certificates so you also need to sign your certificate with a trust root CA. The http servers provides capability to configure https service. So usually it is the end developer's responsibility if they want to use htttps instead of http. What you could do: 1) I think the custom HSTS security policy is forced by your IT/infrastructure team and its applied every update. Please check with them if they can exclude localhost. It doesn’t make sense to force localhost to use https. If you cannot trust localhost, there is a much more serious security problem already. 2) Configure https support. The generated Fiori app uses NodeJS express server to serve http(s) service. You can configure the server to use https. To avoid modifying the express.js server in the generated app, a better approach is to launch a separate reverse proxy server (e.g. nginx or a reverse proxy module in express.js https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-proxy-middleware). And you configure the reverse proxy server to use https. And you server your app from the port number exposed by the reverse proxy server.

Hi , no, this is not the problem, as I connect to an ABAP Environment system where the CA used is known the connection to the ABAP Environment system works, only the final connection to localhost does not work But I found now a solution: Apparently I had a domain security policy in my Chrome for localhost and have used chrome://net-internals/#hsts (at the bottom) to delete this policy for localhost. The deeper problem is of course the local callback not using SSL... Regards,  2021-02-19 13:33:30 -  (I305274) (External Info)

Hello  , Sorry for delay in reply , we were able to get rid of service path post we maintained dev_abap,odata_abap,ui5_execute_abap as WebIDEUsage i Checked with my Developer and he said that odata_gen will not help us as for every service we may have to have a separate url and that will not help but still we need to know what values are to be given in service path in case we have to use odata_gen for any scenario. Also connectivity wise we are able to connect to backend using Basic Authentication. Thanks & Regards,  2021-07-23 08:56:07 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
Thank you for responding, can you confirm what you are trying to setup? Is it an abap catalog or a service url?
There is a difference in configuration if exposeing a service destination i.e. full_url using odata_gen or an abap catalog destination ie. odata_abap. Setting these values means that the various generators will make different API calls to retreive the metadata.
The service centre is a good tool to use to validate any of your changes. Have you been able to validate your destination configuration, using this tool?
 2021-07-23 04:49:41 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hello , We are not worried about connectivity as connectivity is happening, its just we don't know what values should be supplied in service path and as per suggestion we know have maintained dev_abap,odata_abap,ui5_execute_abap as WebIDEUsage and removed odata_gen , post which Service Path field is not coming up Thanks & Regards,  2021-07-22 09:23:47 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
From looking at your destination configuration, you have specified the destinaton as about an odata_gen and and odata_abap along with specfying its a full_url without any service specified in the URL.
To understand more around service URLs and catalog URLs please refer to https://help.sap.com/products/SAP%20Business%20Application%20Studio/9d1db9835307451daa8c930fbd9ab264/7e49887e6fd34182bebeca5a6841a0cc.html
Your destination needs to reflect either a service URL or a catalog URL. However, there is an issue in the current release where if a user specifies both, then the service path and serivces are shown which is incorrect. This is fixed in our next release.
Another way to validate your destination in Business Application Studio, is to select Service Centre tab on the left navigation bar, this will allow you to view the service and system properties. If this does not load, then there is still an configuration issue with your destination.
Please let me know if you any further questions.
 2021-07-22 06:35:33 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hello , Thank you for replying back and checking back , but upon changing as per your recommendation we are seeing below if only using odata_abap: we are getting service list but service path is still coming but when using only odata_gen and WebIDEAdditionalData Property we are not getting service list and its returning "Request failed with status code 404" Please find error screenshot for the same. Thanks & Regards  *PHONE* *EMAIL* 2021-07-21 14:42:59 -  (I305274) (External Info)
Hi Customer,
From inspecting the destination configuration, there are 2 WebIDEUsage properties that have been set:
- odata_abap
- odata_gen

The first property details that the destination is an ABAP catalog, and the second details that the destination is a host and needs a service path.  If the destination should contain an ABAP catalog, please remove the 'odata_gen' property from the destination and try again.

If the host should resolve to a service URL and doesn't need a path to be provided, then please remove the 'odata_abap' property.  You can also add the WebIDEAdditionalData property `full_url`.  This will tell the generator that the destination is configured as a service url and doesn't need a path.

Hi colleagues,
This customer has a destination pointing to their backend, with the odata_abap property. The destination appears to be correctly configured.
However, when they select it in BAS, the field for the Service Path appears, and it's mandatory, instead of treating it like an ABAP repository.
Something I found strange is that 2 fields appear, one for Service Path and another to select the Service. They are able to select the service in the second field, but the field for the Service Path still shows, and they are unable to continue (please see last screenshot of their attached document).
The document also contains information on their architecture, and SCC config (which appears to be fine also).
Could you assist with this?

Product Area selected: SAP HANA Cloud Product Function selected: SAP HANA Cloud  > HANA Cloud Component selected (Product Function Selection): HAN-CLS-HC --- Description --- Hi Team,
At the UX level, we are using the Fiori List Report - Object Page template (created with the App Generator wizard). Inside SAP Business Application Studio (during development and preview) the UX works as we expect.
However, the problem is that once deployed to Cloud Foundry, the UX does not look or work the same. Much of the appearance of the app and the behavior of the app (established through annotations and configuration) is simply not shown or does not work fully.
For example: the table (List Report) does not load automatically however this is specified/configured. Next to that we need to select the columns to be displayed ourselves. See screenshots attached. Also on the community already reports on this.

Hi Team,
As suggested, checking with the debugger and changing the Fiori version did not work either. We are still not sure what was the cause but it seems to be something with the app generator /extension. And pieces of code that do not get generated automatically. Issue is resolved and confirming the incident. Thanks,  2022-05-09 13:22:11 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
Thank you very much for the attached documents. Based on the latest attachments, it seems you are using a deprecated API which is an error in the console log. The network calls are all valid, you can cleanup the i18n properties errors by introducing the missing language files.
At this stage it seems the CAP project is deployed correctly and the Fiori UI is loading corretly i.e the batch and metadata calls are working as expected and the app is loading.
I'm wondering if this is a UI5 version since I can see in the HAR file the following version being loaded
https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/1.101.1/resources/sap/fe/core/library-preload.js
Would you be able to rebuild your local app using 1.101.1, you can specify the exact version in the ui5.yaml. You had mentioned previously local preview works fine.
Please refer to https://blogs.sap.com/2021/04/11/change-sap-ui-version-run-time/ to check your version loaded at runtime.

Hi , Please find the attached screenshots and log files. Thanks,  2022-05-06 11:19:02 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
Just a quick update, I've managed to deploy your app by hacking it so that certain dependencies i.e. HANA and theme references are removed. The apps are able to load correctly;
global_learning_app-srv https://uxtools-sap-ux-stage-qa-global-learning-app-srv.cfapps.sap.hana.ondemand.com/catalog/$metadata -works fine
global-learning-app-approuter https://uxtools-sap-ux-stage-qa-global-learning-app-approuter.cfapps.sap.hana.ondemand.com - works fine and returns a 200 https://uxtools-sap-ux-stage-qa-global-learning-app-approuter.cfapps.sap.hana.ondemand.com/comasmltrainingcostcentersdataui/~050522184239+0000~/api/catalog/$metadata?sap-language=EN-US
This indicates the Fiori app is deployed and the instance based destination is setup correctly to communicate to the CAP project.
It would be great if you could provide, as previosuly stated any of the logs from the respective apps to allow us investigate more what the issue.
Thanks.
 2022-05-05 16:02:45 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
Also, can you please login to your SAP BTP cockpit, select your subaccount, select your space, select applications, select your deployed app i.e. global_learning_app-srv, select logs and verify if there is any exceptions in the logs. You may need to reload your app to repopulate the logs again.
 2022-05-05 15:37:15 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
Sorry, I dont fully understand your last response?
1. Yes, you need either the portal or launchpad service to support managed approuter
2. What is working? Standalone approuter is supported but the configuration is different and requires more steps compared to managed approuter configuration
3. As regards the HAR file, can you please load your Fiori app, open developers tool, network tab and filter by keyword meta. This will show all the network calls being made where with meta in the api call. If possible, it would be great to get the HAR file showing hte network calls since this will show the headers/responses
4. Are there any errors in the console log?
 2022-05-05 14:46:02 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi ,
We can not use a managed approuter because we do not have that entitlement/license. So can not test or use this.
Next to that others did manage to get it working with the standalone approuter. We tried comparing the har files but no luck there yet.
Thanks,  2022-04-29 14:36:55 -  (I313149) (External Info)

Hi,
Thanks for the attachments.
The har file does not seem to record the network calls made for your deployed CF app. Can you please rerun the har files against your deployed app as this might give a reason why the screen properties are not being populated. This might indicate an issue with API destination call.
I'm attaching this blog which details using a managed approuter rather than a standalone router unless you have a specific technical reason for using standalone.
https://blogs.sap.com/2022/02/10/build-and-deploy-a-cap-project-node.js-api-with-a-sap-fiori-elements-ui-and-a-managed-approuter-configuration/
Please let me know if this makes any sense for your requirements?
I will need further time to investigate your issue using standalone router. However, the mta.yaml properties look ok and the uaa for approuter.nodejs seems to be correct as well.
Please be aware that it's a national holiday here in Ireland on Monday, so it will be Tuesday but I have a response around your CAP project. Sorry for the inconvenience.

Hi,
Thank you for providing detailed information for this issue. There are some additional steps you can perform to help with connection issues on SBAS and will provide output that can be attached here.
SAP Fiori Tools Environment Check;
1. From SAP Business Application Studio, open command palette via View -> Find Command and enter "Fiori: Open Environment Check" -> Select your project
If this is a CAP project, ensure its the root folder and not the sub app folder being zipped as we need to see the entire structure.
2. A generated zip file will be created, please attach this to the support ticket

HAR file;
Please provide a full network trace (.har file) with all requests in the reproduced scenario, this should record all the network activity when you load the app on cloud foundry; https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/1990706

Hello BAS Colleagues ,

We have had gone through the issue description as well as the communication summary , we currently don't see this issue to related to the framework because as per customer
the issue is in difference of behavior between preview of BAS studio and the deployed cloud app .
From framework we can't see any issue with our code which can cause these else in the BAS preview also the issue should be reflecting . We feel this needs some more analysis with how the customer  has deployed the app , as we are not point of contact regarding the deployment process in cloud we request you to reach out to the deployment team for further analysis of this issue .
IF you still feel there is any issue with related to our code base , do point us to the same we will be looking into the same and have further analysis done .

Hi Colleagues,

The customer is experiencing issues with apps deployed from BAS. The look and feel of the app is different once deployed and the app behaves different when initially loaded. Please see the summary tab for more details.
The customer states that this issue does not impact other apps deployed so why does this app behave differently?
No errors can be found in the console logs.
As the customer is a cloud customer to access the system please use CAM or request access from the customer.

Hi ,
We do not have special code in place that forces population of the columns other than the ui5 setting "initialLoad": "Enabled", but that is from the ui5 gui in BAS.
If this is needed, please let me know and where to put custom code and how to do it.

Sidenote:
And why do our colleague teams have a working solution without the hassle? We checked the difference many times but cannot come to the conclusion why the appearance on BTP after deployment is different than in our local development area also other developers can not. Thanks,  2022-04-11 09:47:11 -  (I330760) (External Info)
Hi ,

I have reviewed the screenshots provided. The behaviour you are seeing is the expected behaviour in this case. Have you implemented specific code that forces the default columns to be populated on app load in this case? If so, can you please provide the code in this case.
Kind regards,

SAP Support 2022-04-11 08:42:21 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)

Hi ,

The case has now reached the UI5 team. Can you please confirm that the target version within BAS is the same as the system UI5 to which you are deploying? Could you please also provide the screenshots in a word document as the current ones are not clear which makes it difficult to see the issue.

Hi Fiori BAS team,
could you please first look into this issue. The customer reached out on component HANA Cloud database with an issue which seems to be related to deployment of Fiori elements to Cloud Foundry. My colleague found some blog posts and started speculating on things outside the database world.
I would appreciate if you could start a top down analysis to understand where the issue is located.
Thanks for your cooperation.
Best regards,  SAP HANA Cloud database 2022-04-05 09:50:52 -  (D060975) (External Info)
Dear customer,
thank you for raising the ticket with SAP HANA Cloud database component. From the description I understand that some Fiori elements look different after having been deployed through BAS to Cloud Foundry. Since this doesn't seem to be a SAP HANA Cloud database issue, I am involving the BAS Fiori team for further analysis. They will contact you soon.
Best regards,   SAP HANA Development 2022-04-04 22:40:11 -  (I822351) (Internal Info)
HANA QM:
if I were to speculate... according to this blog [1] it appears that a local /webapp/annotations/annotation.xml file is created by the SAP Fiori tooling components/plugins for BAS, maybe it's possible that this annotations folder structure is not included with the bundled web archive (.mtar file) that is pushed to cloud foundry?
[1] https://blogs.sap.com/2021/11/15/fiori-element-list-report-development-using-sap-business-application-studio-bas-guided-tools/

Dear Customer,
I hope you are doing well. Thank you for reaching SAP HANA Support. We’ll be more than happy to assist you with your issue. We’ll begin our investigation and get back to you with an update.

From this morning, on every SAPUI5 projects in our BAS, the “UI5 Languange Assistant tool” shows many Errors on every XML files. Most errors are for instance:
class can't have an empty ID attribute when flexEnabled is "true"
It seems related to SAPUI5 flexibility feature and with the setting of flexEnabled flag set to true in the manifest.json. (see SAPUI5 Flexibility: Enable Your App for UI Adaptation). This setting was already set to true, and this error never shows before.

More generally, the tool shows many errors in XML views ( I attach an example of an xml view and the its list of errors), but the application itself runs correctly both locally and deployed despite the errors.
Can you help us to understand why the tool suddenly shows this kind of error? Could we encounter in some issues (like not compatibility of sapui5 version, inconsistency of the applications or the app doesn’t work)?

Hi ,
From reviewing this case so far, the main questions I see are:
- why have these errors from ui5-language-assistant starting appearing: I'm not sure on this as it is not something our component is responsible for, it is possible that an update in the ui5-language-assistant extension has caused these to start showing. if you want these errors to be reported as an issue for the extension (ui5-language-assistant) as this is in open source then please create an issue here https://github.com/SAP/ui5-language-assistant and the relevant colleagues can review and respond.
- should id's be added: I have checked with colleagues and the errors are valid, if you want to have flexEnabled set to true to you would need to have id's maintained for the controls. If flex is not required for you app it can be set to false, but as you have linked below there are warnings and considerations in doing this. Depending if you raise an issue with the extension as above, you could hold off on adding id's to await their response.
For reference, here is some documentation we provide on usage of UI5 Language Assistant in SAP Fiori tools (this component):
https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_FIORI_tools/17d50220bcd848aa854c9c182d65b699/17efa217f7f34a9eba53d7b209ca4280.html#ui5-language-assistant-support

Hi Support, if we add an ID to every xml control, we no longer get the error. According to the documentation, i don't know if it is the best choice because of the following statement founded here https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/topic/f1430c0337534d469da3a56307ff76af:

If you set the flag to false, your application won’t work with any UI adaptation tool. In certain scenarios it can make sense to do this, for example, for a beta release when you still expect major changes for the app. However, do not change the flexEnabled flag to false after your application has been delivered. This would lead to incompatibilities and regressions if a key user has adapted the UI in the meantime. Do you suggest adding an ID to every control in every xml? Why weren't we getting errors before, even without ids? Best Regards,  2022-11-01 04:28:38 -  (I062601) (External Info)
Dear ,
Could you check if "flexEnabled" or "stable ID" has changed ? For example, could you try to add "stable ID" for the controls or remove the property "flexEnabled": true in the manifest ?

Hi Support, we get error messages only in Business Application studio IDE. I guess these errors are thrown by BAS UI5 Language Assistant. You're correct, the applications work despite the error messages. Best Regards,  2022-10-26 07:10:38 -  (I062601) (External Info)
Dear ,
Your incident has been routed to the CA-WDE-VE support team. I understand that the applications works correctly. When do you get these error messages ? Is the output triggered by some operation?
I can't find the documents relevant this message for now.

Solution provided: Dear Customer,

Thank you for having a screen sharing session to discuss the issue.
As discussed, the issue happened due to usage of position other than 10,20, 30...in UI.lineItem CDS annotation which is not translated to XML annotation correctly due to usage of some other older components.
As Application Modeler view shows columns that are found in the XML annotations, other columns were marked as errors.

Here some additional information which I would recommend:

Dear Customer,

I hope you can access my previous reply on 13.04.2021 16:05:23.
In addition to that,
1] Could you please let you know the UI5 version you plan to use in your application?
2] Could you also share the package.json of your application

Please also perform following troubleshooting steps:
If you plan to use UI5 version 1.71, please check if

"@sap/ux-specification": "UI5-1.71" is maintained in your package.json

Value UI5-1.71 is based on dist-tags mentioned here https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sap/ux-specification
If this is not the case, then delete your node_modules folder, package-lock.json file and run npm i again.
Reload your window and then expand the Application Modeler view to generate schemas again.

Please let us know if the troubleshooting steps solves your issue.

Hello , I tried various possibilities to reach SAP Business Application Studio, but nothing works. I was able to log on to R/3 SAP GUI and also Fiori Launchpad using Fiori HTTPS FLP, but FLP is blank. I am missing link to SAP Business Application Studio. It would be nice we can have a short sync.

Dear Colleagues, Json page descriptor has lines deleted automatically when using Application Modeler. Could you please assist? Regards,  2021-04-06 14:46:44 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
: Yes it is; I sent you the source code for the CDS view that the entity set schema is generated from. You should be able to cross-check the column names from the CDS view source against the BAS screenshot that shows the warning underlines. As well, I confirmed that the column names were correct using the UI5 diagnostic tool via CTRL-ALT-SHIFT-S. Are you able to execute the application from our system and / or view the code from our BAS instance? Do we need to schedule a TEAMS meeting so that you can see the issue? As well, even though the column definitions could be inaccurate (i.e. mis-spelt column name), why does the BAS editor actively delete the code? Regards, D. 2021-04-06 08:26:17 -  (I500442) (External Info)
Hi , The warnings appear according to your local schema ( "../.schemas/ListReport_ZC_SZCOC20_ATP_ListType.json") and not from BAS. Please validate your schema is correct. Regards,  2021-04-05 14:16:17 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
: The source code for the exposed CDS view entity set is attached as "CDS View ZC_SZCOC20_ATP_List.txt". Regards, D. 2021-04-05 13:12:42 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
: Yes; the schema is the correct name for the entity set. The name of the application is "zoc20_atp"; you should be able to execute the transaction in our development Fiori system and see all of the objects. As well, the exposed entity set is available for you to see in our development ECC system via transaction SEGW; the SEGW project is named "ZOC20". I'm not sure if you are able to access our BAS instance. If needed, we can arrange a TEMS meeting and I will show you the behavior of the BAS editing session. Thanks, D. 2021-04-04 13:18:24 -  (I500442) (External Info)
Dear Customer, I couldn't reproduce your problem. I get errors that the schema you attached is not a valid JSON file. Could you please check your schema? is it the right file "../.schemas/ListReport_ZC_SZCOC20_ATP_ListType.json"? Also, could you please verify this schema? it seems the warnings are based on it.

Dear Customer, I see you're using a custom schema in your JSON file: "$schema": "../.schemas/ListReport_ZC_SZCOC20_ATP_ListType.json" It seems the warnings come from this schema.

Correction to previous message: After upgrading libraries, BAS editor no longer removes flagged lines immediately; however, after saving the project yesterday and editing again today, the lines that were flagged as incorrect have now been removed from the List Page JSON file. 2021-03-24 22:50:41 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Since upgrading libraries to version 1.71.33, the BAS editor no longer deletes column definitions flagged as incorrect. However, random columns are flagged as incorrect; underlined with orange wavy line, and reported as "Property XXXXXX is not allowed" when hovered with mouse. All such columns are not adjusted to requested size. This creates a very poor user experience, as the default column widths are huge, resulting in user having to do a lot of horizontal scrolling. The BAS project that demonstrates this issue is "zoc20_atp". We are now getting close to finishing development, and this is now becoming a higher priority for user acceptance. 2021-02-23 14:08:21 -  (I331841) (Internal Info)

I have found further details of this error as described below: When cursor is placed on some of the column definitions, the column header text is displayed; on other columns the reference to the i18n property is displayed (see attached "BAS Editor Screenshot.pdf"). As well, in the page editor mode, the same symptoms are displayed (see attached "BAS Page Editor Screenshot.jpg"). Finally, not all of the entity columns are displayed in the page editor mode; the elements that are missing are the elements that get auto-deleted from the JSON page definition file.

Hi Team,

Thank you very much for the quick response. Lookslike your screenshot is missing on this incident. I have attached our BAS screenshot "view->plugins", I see lot of components so don't know which one I should check and confirm for the latest Fiori tools. Can you please guide me.
Best regards,  *EMAIL* Mobile: 225-715-2352 2022-09-27 20:25:34 -  (I802475) (External Info)
Dear customer,
I understand you are looking for the fix that addressed the issue in incident 513324. The fix was stated to be in "Fiori tools 1.74".
Since you are on BAS, you should have received an auto date of the extensions from Fiori tools. You can confirm this by checking in "View->Plugins" as shown in the screen shot.
If you have the correct version of the extensions, please retry and let us know if the fix doesn't address the problem.
Best regards,

Hi,
Can you please clarify your exact requirement?
Are you looking to expose a destination that exposes a catalog of services or a single service?
Are you looking to build and deploy this application to Cloud Foundry/ABAP?
It might be worth reading the following documentation;
Please refer to https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/0003063160 or https://help.sap.com/doc/97abfdee97f744ed8987154fe3a78c0f/CF/en-US/SAP_Web_IDE_en.pdf around the specific properties attributed to a destination, please read Page 57-59.
As regards ds4-s4hana2020-dt, this is configured with a host of http://dwpflpsrv:123/sap/bc/ui2/cdm3/entities
If you want to call this endpoint directly to see what it returns then execute this curl command;
curl "$H2O_URL/destinations/ds4-s4hana2020-dt/" -vs > curl-datasrv-output.txt 2>&1
If this is a single OData service then you can call;
curl "$H2O_URL/destinations/ds4-s4hana2020-dt/$metadata" -vs > curl-datasrv-metadata-output.txt 2>&1
`sap/bc/ui2/cdm3/entities`path needs to be exposed via your cloud connector in order to be consumed via a destination.
Again, if this endpoint is not exposing an OData service then it will not work in Fiori Tools as all calls expect an odata service catalog or odata service endpoint to be exposed. If you want to expose a destination that returns a different type of data structure, then you will need to create a Fiori Freestyle application, building your own custom controller and views to support the data structure. This is outside the scope of Fiori Tools support.
Here is a tutorial on using Northwind OData Services using an OData service URL
https://blogs.sap.com/2021/04/16/extension-of-fiori-elementslist-report-object-page-using-northwind-service-in-visual-studio./
We can setup a call today to discuss this further.

Hi , Thanks for the informative blog, we go though the same however we still are looking to get resolution for the issue we are facing when trying to consume the Odata using the Odata url method i.e, Data Source selected as "Connect to an Odata Service" which is the ideal way to consume Odata as per on SAP BTP BAS as per KBA 3063160 The way we were able to consume the Odata mentioned in the last communication is just a workaround not a solution to our issue being faced.

Regards
 2022-01-04 20:17:14 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Solution provided: Customer is able to generate a Fiori application using a v2 service exposed via an onpremise destination.
I would suggest more hands-on tutorials for the customer to ensure they understand how odata services work and how to leverage Fiori Tools to expose their onpremise systems using Fiori Elements. 2022-01-04 20:14:44 -  (I313149) (External Info)

Hi,
Please refer to the following link to understand service catalogs
https://help.sap.com/viewer/68bf513362174d54b58cddec28794093/7.52.8/en-US/7ca326519eff236ee10000000a445394.html
Service catalog versions i.e. v2 | v4 definie how the data model is represented to the UI, these are generic definitions and a breakdown can be found here;
https://www.odata.org/documentation/odata-version-2-0/overview/
Based on your latest attachment, you are able to consume the ds4 destination. You created a Fiori application using the ds4 destination as the data source as this is the destination you choose. This will allow you to run your application locally to validate its retrieving the data from the backend correctly via the ds4 destination configuration.
Again, if you dont have any v4 services to expose from your backend then there is no further changes required. Remember, versions i.e. v2 | v4 represents data differently to the UI thus not all Fiori templates will work with V4 OData services.
Please refer to this tutorial group for more hands-on tutorials to understand how Fiori and our tooling works.
https://developers.sap.com/group.fiori-tools-lrop.html
I hope this answers your questions. I would suggest taking some time to understand destinations and odata services to give you more of an appreciation of what is happening in the background.
Here are some additional links for you;

Please ignore my comment in point 2, it does list all destinations was having view issue. Regards,
 2022-01-04 18:58:49 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi ,
1. Could you enlighten what is V2 & V4 catalog ? 2. Was assuming query : curl $H2O_URL/api/listDestinations > dest.json >&1 would fetch all the destination present in our SAP BTP environment, is this understanding wrong ? as we are seeing only 1 destination in the output i.e, ds4-s4hana2020-dt 3. ds4-s4hana2020-dt is the design time destination, created in context with SAP Launchpad content federation, this defines the location from which to fetch the content that was exposed by the content provider. While troubleshooting we realized we are able to access the Odata we have been trying to and it seems to be of V2 category. We are able to access it using "Connect to a System" option in Data Source instead of "Connect to an Odata Service" as shown in the attached document. To my knowledge while opting Data Source method as "Connect to a System" its leveraging the ds4 destination, would you help us understand which destination is being used while opting for method "Connect to an Odata Service". If it's ds4-s4hana2020-dt then we might need to maintain same property as in ds4 destination. And this eliminates configuring Cloud Connector / destinations in SAP BTP CF environment to expose V4 catalogs Please advise me, if i am going wrong.
Regards

Hi,
Thank you for responding;
A quick summary of each service call; 1. ds4 v2 catalog This returns a valid response and shows ZUI_CREDITACCOUNT_DISPLAY_0001 as an exposed service Thus you should be able to call the following curl command to retrieve the service metadata; curl "$H2O_URL/destinations/ds4/sap/opu/odata/sap/ZUI_CREDITACCOUNT_DISPLAY_0001/$metadata" -vs > curl-v2catalog-service-output.txt 2>&1 An alternative, is to open Business Application Studio, select the `Service Centre` tab on the left navigation bar, select your destination i.e. ds4, if configured correctly, the service and system properties will be returned 2. ds4 v4 catalog Returns the following error; Access denied to resource /sap/opu/odata4/iwfnd/config/default/iwfnd/catalog/0002/ServiceGroups on system dwpflpsrv:123.
In case this was a valid request, ensure to expose the resource correctly in your cloud connector. Which indicates your cloud connector is not configured to expose v4 catalogs Please refer to https://blogs.sap.com/2020/06/25/part-2-connect-to-on-premise-apis-from-sap-cloud-platform-api-management-cloud-foundry-environment/ for more information on exposing your API's
If you make any modifications to your cloud connector or backend, please re-validate again with the v4 catalog curl command;
curl "$H2O_URL/destinations/ds4/sap/opu/odata/IWFND/CATALOGSERVICE;v=2/ServiceCollection?%24top=1" -vs > curl-v2catalog-output.txt 2>&1
3. ds4-s4hana2020-dt v2 catalog Returns Internal Server Error indicating the endpoint is not available or the cloud connector is not configured correctly. However, the host you have defined is exposing http://dwpflpsrv:123/sap/bc/ui2/cdm3/entities, What is the expected behaviour here? 4. ds4-s4hana2020-dt v4 catalog Returns Internal Server Error indicating the endpoint is not available or the cloud connector is not configured correctly Again, the host you have defined is exposing http://dwpflpsrv:123/sap/bc/ui2/cdm3/entities, What is the expected behaviour here? You will need to give more clarity around the destination ds4-s4hana2020-dt and what you are trying to do here? It has no WebIDEUsage property so it will not be picked up by either the Service Centre or Fiori Tools since its they expect certain properties to exist to indicate if its an ABAP OData endpoint. Please refer to https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/0003063160 or https://help.sap.com/doc/97abfdee97f744ed8987154fe3a78c0f/CF/en-US/SAP_Web_IDE_en.pdf around the specific properties attributed to a destination, please read Page 57-59. I've attached ValidateDestinationCockpit.txt to the support ticket, this is a good way to validate your destination independent of BAS or Cloud Foundry (CF). Please follow the instructions and report back with any screenshots where appropriate.
Your question regarding which destination is being used, ds4-s4hana2020-dt is not a valid OData destination so it will not be used. However, ds4 seems to be configured correctly for v2 services only.

Hi,
Thank you for the response.
In your attached zip, you attached a screenshot of the command, however its the generated output that is required. Can you please attach the generated output from the listDestinations command, this should have produced a dest.json file which can be attached to the support ticket.
List Destinations Call
dest.json missing from attachement
Single Service Call
metatata.xml missing from attachement but the screenshot shows a HTTP 502 error indicating the service ZGWP_FI_INCOMING_PAYMENTS_SRV is not available.
To understand about exposing services via your cloud connector, please refer to this link;
https://blogs.sap.com/2018/11/12/how-to-setup-cloud-connection/
V4 Catalog Call
V4 is returning the following error;
Access denied to resource /sap/opu/odata4/iwfnd/config/default/iwfnd/catalog/0002/ServiceGroups on system dwpflpsrv:123. In case this was a valid request, ensure to expose the resource correctly in your cloud connector.
Along with a 403 HTTP error which indicates the v4 catalog/path is not exposed correctly in your cloud connector.
Please refer to the following knowledge article detailing how to configure the service.

Its not returning an OData xml response but instead a Feed response indicating a particular service is not available since the release status is set to NOT_RELEASED. I'm not aware of your requirements or configuration but these link(s) might be helpful to understand your issue.

My understanding is that you are exposing a service that is using a function in your application that is not released for customer use.
Please beaware that support will be limited until the team returns in January.

Hi ,
Thank you for your time on our call earlier. I have reviewed this issue further and I am now sending this case to our development team for further analysis. You will be updated as soon as new information is available.
I am also adjusting the priority of the message to High in accordance with SAP procedures. I do not believe this issue warrants the use of Very High status as per SAP's criteria laid out in the attached note ##67739 Priorities of problem messages. As this is not a production down scenario and there is a temporary workaround available (connecting as a system). We will continue to work on this issue with high priority.
See note ##19500 The priority of your message has been changed.
If you wish to have this case as a very high you will need to provide us with the following details:
- Is this a production down situation? - a direct 24x7 contact number - a detailed Business Impact statement - exactly how does this issue affect the business, what is the nature of your business, what type of information is being carried in the messages that are stuck - a Financial Impact statement (estimated cost per day of this issue)

Dear Colleagues,
Customer is having an issue connecting to an OData service when using a template to create a BAS application. They are using the SAPUI5 freestyle template. When they try to connect to an OData Service as their data source and enter the URL below there is no error but when they click next and error appears in BAS. This error is:
{"message":"@sap/fiori:app generator failed - process.on(uncaughtException) process.on(uncaughtException) env.on(error) Cannot read property 'source' of undefined","stack":"TypeError: env.on(error) Cannot read property 'source' of undefined at default_1.prompting (/extbin/npm/globals/lib/node_modules/@sap/generator-fiori/generators/fiori-freestyle/app/index.js:1:67583) at processTicksAndRejections (internal/process/task_queues.js:97:5)"}
OData URL: https://*SAP-ID*-ds4.priv.nprd.fin.purolator.com:8001/sap/opu/odata/SAP/ZGWP_FI_INCOMING_PAYMENTS_SRV
These steps are shown in full in BAS issue.docx
They have also created a destination in BTP to connect to this service. When they use this destination in their BAS project by selecting "Connect to a system" as their data source they can select the service and all works correctly and the error does not appear
I have reproduced this issue on a call with the customer and they have provided cloud connector traces from this. From these traces it seems the connection is established however I do see a Ignore unknown or unsupported extension message at 15:53:41 in the logs
Can you assist the customer here

Hi ,
Sorry to hear you can't access https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/topic/653ed0f4f0d743dbb33ace4f68886c4e.  I had checked outside of the SAP corporate network and I could access it, but apologies that you can't.  I think your issue is now resolved, correct?  The relevant portion of the documentation that I was trying to link to is:

Transformation Aggregation
In the metadata, such entity sets have the Aggregation.ApplySupported set and Aggregation.ApplySupportedType must be Transformations. The Analytics.AggregatedProperties must then list all the aggregatable measures/aggregation methods that are used.

For more information, see Transformation Aggregation.

Best regards,


2022-06-09 08:52:05 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi , @Aggregation.ApplySupported.Transformations      : true makes the difference. Now I can see the object during generation. The problem is, that I am not able to access the document, you have been sharing. Thanks for your support so far. best regards  2022-06-08 11:36:17 -  (I305274) (External Info)
Hi ,

The following documentation should be available for you to view, https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/topic/653ed0f4f0d743dbb33ace4f68886c4e.  Please see the section under "Transformation Aggregation".

Please also see below for an example of the associated CAP CDS annotations:

Hi ,

Very sorry about that, the link has disappeared for me too :(.  It was available yesterday, I will try to find the latest version and update this support case.

Hi , thanks for getting back on this. Unluckily I am not able to access the document u shared. Sorry, we can't find the page you're looking for I'll set the annotations, will test and let u know. best regards  2022-06-07 11:24:26 -  (I305274) (External Info)
Dear customer,
Thanks for providing details of the metadata being used to generate your ALP V4 application.  The list of entities displayed is filtered to those that support "Transformation Aggregation".

Please see the "Transformation Aggregation" section at the bottom of the document https://help.sap.com/docs/SAPUI5/96880755e4e64fcd96c12694f430fece/653ed0f4f0d743dbb33ace4f68886c4e.html?locale=en-US&state=DRAFT for full details.

The entity needs to have the Aggregation.ApplySupported set and Aggregation.ApplySupportedType must be Transformations.
Please see an example in the documentation above.
Best regards,

2022-06-03 14:25:22 -  (I051442) (Internal Info)
Hello colleagues,
Sorry for the late forward.
The customer is using CAP node.JS (which anyway is not a suitable solution for analytics) but I tested the ALP generation from the UX tools ona proper CAP Node java service and I do get the same message.
Is it a know limitation on the Tools side?
Kind regards.
. 2022-05-24 10:19:37 -  (I051442) (External Info)
Dear customer,

We are looking at this issue and will come back to you shortly.
Please note that CAP Node.js has a limited support on the transformations needed  to use an analytic service (please see https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/advanced/odata#transformations).
Grouping in your case cannot be achieved (concat, orderBy for example are needed).
If you want to implement an analytical service, we recommend you to use the CAP Java version instead.

Kind regards.

Hello ,
Thank you for your time this morning. Please upload the annotations file generated metadata when you get a chance. I am involving development as discussed.

Thank you,  SAP Support 2022-05-23 20:43:21 -  (I830433) (Internal Info)
Hello CA-UI5-ST-ALP dev,
customer is trying to use the template generator, but running into an issue of the error: The OData V4 service you have provided is not suitable for use in an Analytical List Page application. The service must contain aggregate based entity sets for this floorplan when at the stage where they should pick an entity set of local CAP project in ALP template wizard.
the customer showed me the CAP project and annotations, and it does indeed appear that there is an aggregation that would apply, so it's not clear why the above error is coming. The same OData service works well for other template applications like OVP.
The customer will upload the generated metadata and the annotation file, but hasn't done so yet.

Thank you,  Support 2022-05-23 20:37:47 -  (I830433) (External Info)

Hello ,
From the deployment error screenshots attached the issue seems to be with the TLS version the server certificate has been signed with ( --tls-min-v1.0 to npm run deploy might get you over this hump.
On Windows, you can do it like this:
(Powershell) $env:NODE_OPTIONS='--tls-min-v1.0'; npm run deploy
(Note, the '$' is part of the command above).
(cmd.exe): set NODE_OPTIONS='--tls-min-v1.0' && npm run deploy

On Posix systems (Linux, OS X, etc):
NODE_OPTIONS='--tls-min-v1.0' npm run deploy

Come to the `dist` folder, you should already have one. Running `npm run deploy` will run a build step first and a `dist` folder should be created (you can verify the script in your `package.json`).

Cheers,

No SAPUI5 Fiori App with this ID exists. In the launchpad designer, check the entry of the ID field of the tile/target mapping configuration. A SAPUI5 Fiori App with this ID exists in the SAPUI5 ABAP repository, but the app index is not set up correctly Ensure the app index is set up correctly.

Hello , the problem was solved now. I was a org member with the roles "Org Manager" but no space member. After adding my user as a space member with role "Space Developer" and "Space Manager", now the error messages disappear. And after using the wizard again in the BAS, now the destination service abap-cloud-destination-instance was created automatically in the background. Thank you so much for you help. I will close the incident now. Regards  2021-05-17 23:25:27 -  (I058153) (External Info)
Solution provided: Hi ,
Sorry for the delayed response.

A destination will be created during the Fiori application generator for the abap service instance.
To manage destinations and certificates on service instance level (all CRUD operations), you must be assigned to one of the following roles: OrgManager, SpaceManager or .

This can be manually test with a command such as :
cf create-service destination lite testdest1

If this succeeds please try creating the Fiori application via the Wizard again.

Kind regards,

Hi Colleagues,
I just got this ticket back to your queue, however the problem to be analysed resides on BAS side.

Customer is trying to deploy one App from BAS using the description "STRY0450509-New Billing Terms & Allow Overages Fields Fiori"
However when reaching the back-end we could see that the & is not escaped which leads to errors.

Question is:
1. Is this possible to escape/restrict this character when sending the backend call for deployment?
2. Is there any correction available related to this scenario?

Thank you 2022-08-22 20:34:29 -  (I829208) (Internal Info)
Dear CA-UI5-ABA-SAR,
I hope to get more information on this. This ticket was passed on to us. Basically, the last processor of this ticket made some manual chages in the project (Please check the attachment "Changes Made.doc")

Hi Team,
Yes, I was able to deploy (manual changes) successfully to ABAP gateway system. It is working fine now in BAS editor and fiori dashboard.

Earlier when we tested our changes (with special chararcter (&) in description) in the BAS editor it worked fine, and didn’t throw any syntax errors.And the error occurred while deploying it and the error message was not that clear, it says request failed with status code 400 but not saying which file and/or line has the sysntax error.
It would be easy if we get descriptive error messages on the error log. I was wondering whether the given SAP notes (by , SAP support) if implemented will provide detailed error messages/allow special characters for similar future issues.
Can you please check and confirm.
Thank you!

Hi colleagues,
The customer is facing issues with custom task "deploy-to-abap". Since this is not a standard task of the UI5 Tooling, we unfortunately can't provide any support for it.
Could you please take over? Please feel free to reach out to us in case you find any issues with standard UI5 Tooling APIs.

Hi colleagues,
In this Case, a UI5 app couldn't be deployed to the customer's ABAP system using ui5-deploy.yaml and a custom task deploy-to-abap because the project files contained the character "&" in several places. After removing all "&", the customer was able to deploy the app (See "Changes made.docx"). I'm wondering why "&" needs to be removed/escaped in the first place.. Sounds like a misconfiguration in the customer's ABAP system somewhere.
But from the UI5 Tooling's perspective; is it a common practice to escape characters before deploying the app to an ABAP system? If so, is there something missing from the project's Tooling configuration?
Thanks & best regards, (Unfortunately there is no possibility to clone the customer's project yet)

Currently he is running with Kernel 753 patch 1000.
By removing the  then CALL TRANSFORMATION worked fine.

Can you confirm whether this is expected or can be a bug?

Thank you

Hi ,

Thank you very much for looking at it and providing the solution. I removed the symbol (&) from the description and then was able to deploy the changes to Gateway successfully.

 from SAP Support on this OSS message recommended implementing the below SAP notes for this error. Since the below SAP notes are talking about upgrading UI5 service packs, our BASIS team is reviewing and implementing it in the sandbox first. Can you please check and confirm whether the below notes will resolve future issues related to special characters on the description, because when we tested our changes (with char & in description) in the BAS editor it worked fine, and didn’t throw any syntax errors. This error occurred while deploying it and it was not that clear.

Dear ,
Thank you very much for remote connection provided.
Checking the scenario we identified that the request contains the objet definition and its description is the following
"STRY0450509-New Billing Terms & Allow Overages Fields Fiori"
Currently the character & is causing the problem during the parsing

Would be possible to try the following. Repeat the process however replace the character & with - for instance.
Please let us know about the outcome

Best regards

I reviewed this and the issue seems to be occurring at gateway perspective:

I'm involving colleagues from Gateway team in order to assist with investigating if there is in fact an issue at Gateway side.

Dear colleagues,
I tried contacting an OPU-GW-COR colleague 4h ago in order to swarm but there was no response. So I'm involving you based on my research and error message.
Why am I involving you? Based on the error message, I suspect that Gateway is unable to correctly read/process the information it is receiving. I found a similar case where the cause was that customer was sending a file with wrong type (xml instead of json).
Could you please assist with investigating this from Gateway perspective?

Dear Mod
I could fix the problem.
I was able to specify a CAP project that implements authentication as the data source for Fiori Elements. The cause was that when setting the destination, the URL should be specified up to the host part, but other paths were also entered. I think the poor implementation of authentication is another issue. If necessary, we will raise the OSS as a separate matter. Thank you for a  time. This case will be closed.  2021-08-05 09:39:57 -  (I301224) (External Info)

As the first call was successful , I think the authentication defined in the destination is >> ok, However for the last two it looks like the BE(ABAP) system wasn't configured correctly >> and these end points was probably not exposed as necessary.

Following customer reply and attachment , I've checked BAS-GW/Approuter logs and found

/destinations/CAP_CloudSDK_test4/sap/bc/adt/ato/settings","method":"GET" => with response 404 from the destination backend
As the first call was successful , I think the authentication defined in the destination is ok, However for the last two it looks like the BE(ABAP) system wasn't configured correctly and these end points was probably not exposed as necessary.
In addition customer asks how should the url be maintained in the destination and used later in the Fiori wizard.

As you pointed out, does the destination need to enter only the host part in the URL? When I entered only the host part, 200: OK was returned by check connection. If I only need to enter the host part in destination, how do you specify '/odata/v4/cloud.sdk.capng/', which is the common part of the URI of this API?

curl https://fujitsu-limited-cfazure-cfazurespace-cloudsdk-test4-srv.cfapps.jp20.hana.ondemand.com/odata/v4/AdminService/
curl CAP_bookstore_srv2.dest/odata/v4/AdminService/$metadata
curl CAP_CloudSDK_test4.dest/odata/v4/AdminService/$metadata
===
In BAS backend logs I couldn't find any use in destination 'CAP_CloudSDK_test4' , however I did see a use of destination 'CAP_bookstore_srv2'.
Could it be that you have another destination in the subaccount that points to a similar url ?
Please verify and see if you can remove CAP_bookstore_srv2 destination (you can export its configuration via the cockpit UI).

After changing your subaccount destination, execute the following command, this command will clean the destination list your Devspace store in its temporary cache.
curl http://localhost:8887/reload

Now start the template wizard again and check if you get a different (better) result.
In addition from looking at your destination screenshot I suggest
1. keep either odata_gen or odata_abap in the WebIDEUsage.
2. in case the url is absolute to the service and not to the host, add WebIDEAdditionalData = full_url

Waiting for your reply and results Thanks and best regards Roy

Dear 
I noticed the attached Har file is from May 18th and I have no access to see BAS server logs from that time, Can you please reproduce and provide updated HAR file?
Also in the Har file that was supplied I don't see any call that seems related to a destination call, please make sure the new HAR file captures the problematic scenario.

I would like to find if I see any error in the log regarding the destination you mentioned. (CAP_CloudSDK_test4)

Dear  I tried getting access the application. Strangely, I tried two methods, one successful but the other unsuccessful. The access was successful when the way of obtaining the access token and the get request were separated. (as attachments : Get_Access_Token.png,Get_reqest_to_cloudsdk_test4.png)

However, when Oauth 2.0 is set for authorization and a request is sent, the response of the request will be 403 even if the access token can be obtained.
(as a attachment : Get_reqest_to_cloudsdk_test4(using OAuth2.0).png) I don't understand why one way is Not authorized. Please Point me out if my implementation has problems. I also send attachment the Postman's request collection : (CAP_Authentication_test.postman_collection.json.

Dear Customer,
For further investigation I would like to verify the following:
Please make sure you follow this documentation of OAuth Client Credentials Authentication: https://help.sap.com/viewer/cca91383641e40ffbe03bdc78f00f681/Cloud/en-US/e75d7f15b808428e87ae70f494da0b42.html Please see the note about the user name and password you should use. Please try to access the oData service with Postman or other tools, to verify you are indeed authorized to access it.  Found this that might help - https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/authorization/#oauth-20
Please update if you are able to access the system.

Thanks,

Dear colleagues,
Please see below summary from product support regarding issue with authentication when accessing OData service for template generation.
Seems that the destination is configured with oAuth2 authentication and for some reason there is authentication failure in this case.
Network trace is attached but not really relevant as the request is called from BAS backend side. But you can see there which exact landscape the customer is using (I've noticed it is Azure).
Can you please take a look at the logs and see if there is some error? Can you please assist the customer?
Please note that if you need more information about the exact request - please ask this information from component CA-UX-IDE who are the template owners.
Thanks,

Solution provided: Hi ,
Thanks for the call earlier in the week. As discussed there were 2 main issues:
1. Want to be able to add a service to an Fiori Freestyle application that was created with datasource None in BAS.
As I mentioned this is a know gap and will be fixed in one of the upcoming releases of Fiori tools.
2. Want to be able change the destination (via wizard/tool) in an existing Fiori application so that all appropriate files are updated.
This is a new requirement and I've added the feature request at https://github.wdf.sap.corp/ux-engineering/tools-suite-support/issues/212. Sorry it is not publicly accessible, but please reference this in any future communication.
As mentioned in the call, when migrating the Fiori application to use Fiori tools is a good time to change the destination as it updates all the files needed. But of course migration is a one time activity hence the feature request.
Until that is provided using find and replace on the project files to replace the destination is also possible.

I suggest we close this issue.

Kind regards,

2022-05-17 05:16:52 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
16.05.2022 - we got the committment of SAP that there is no adequate way to change the destinations with a wizard after migration. Therefore we ask you to provide wizards in order to perform this task. thanks. 2022-05-15 05:49:59 -  (I829208) (Internal Info)

Hi, I sent you an appointment for upcoming monday. Regards  2022-05-12 03:55:00 -  (I829208) (External Info)
Hi ,
This is  from SAP Fiori tools and I will help you with your issue.
, the reason we wanted to get more details from you is because we are currently refactoring Service Manager to accomodate more use cases and add the ability to add/sync services similar to what we have in the Fiori generator. It will be great if we can have a quick meeting over your requirement and see how we can expedite your exact scenario, and at the same time provide you with some simpler manual choices so that you are not blocked. Your feedback is very valid and we are working on it with priority. PLease send me a mail at *EMAIL* and I will send you the meeting details.

Best Regards,
 2022-05-10 09:06:44 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi, you do not need my project. I just want an answer if you have a wizard which creates a service AFTER creation. I know that there is a wizard AT the creation. But I want to add a service afterwards at a freestyle UI5 app. You can test this with EVERY project - you do not need mine for it. Your solutions so far do simply NOT work in BAS. Test it yourself. Create an app - and say at the beginning NONE Service. And if the FREESTYLE app is ready - THEN add a service  - HOW (without changing the files manually..)? Or is there a YEOMAN wizard??? Regards  2022-05-10 08:43:46 -  (I057951) (External Info)
Hi ,
Sorry to hear this did not work for you.
Can you please confirm how was your project generated, Service Manager is part of Fiori tools and supports the projects created by the tools.
If its ok with you, can you please attach your project with this issue so that we can investigate.
You will need to use the following command from command palette Fiori: Open Environment Check->Archive
This will generate a zip folder of your project which you can download and attach to this issue.
Regards,
 2022-05-09 06:09:57 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)

Solution provided: Dear Customer,
You can add a service to an Overview page and a SAPUI5 freestyle application using the service manager tool. Please refer to below documentation.

Hello, thanks for the link. I just found the option to add a new service at the generation of the application using the wizard. But NOT to add it to an already existing application.

Dear Colleagues,
Customer was trying to select a system with 'Consume SAP Services' command and received the following error: Consume SAP Services failed. Reason: Could not retrieve the services

This seems to be coming from the 'vscode-wing-odata-service-tools' extension, so CA-BAS-CNSM seemed to be the correct component for the issue.

Hello ,
@sap/ux-specification is a npm package that should be added to each project separately as "devDependency", it is should match the SAP UI5 version that is used by the project and can be updated as any other npm package.
To update the @sap/ux-specification you need to update the its version number in the projects package.json file's dependency section. After that run command "npm install" from that directory. Restarting VSCode might be required afterwards for the new version to be picked up by the SAP Fiori Tools extensions.

The zip file I originally attached, which is the one that is still attached, does contain the XML file for annotation from our namespace. I didn't upload a new version. I reached out to the Fiori Tools team and they have confirmed the problem. 2022-04-27 07:28:23 -  (D022159) (External Info)
Hello , I can see the difference now: the problem was that you old zip file did not comprises the DSN xml, thus the facet annotations had not been present. In the new version I can see the UI.Facets. Will debug the problem now. 2022-04-27 07:06:57 -  (D022159) (External Info)
Hello , I had analyzed your annotations together with , and it looked like the ContractItemType has no Ui.Facets, but I will check again on my own, based on your zip. 2022-04-26 14:53:08 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
, Sorry but that is not correct, I have a metadata extension for the CDS view /DSN/C_CONTRACT_ASSIGN_ITEM (ContractItem) See attached, and it has annotations for various controls on the object page, incl facets and field groups. I've also just resynced the project with the service modeler, and I can definitely see annotations for the ContractEntity. So please would you explain in more detail what you mean by "there are no annotations defined for the Object Page ContractItemType entity" Also what other problem have you discovered? 2022-04-26 08:14:52 -  (D040068) (External Info)
Dear Customer,
We have analyzed your case - please be aware of the fact, section on an Object Page are defined by corresponding annotations. When you check your application, you can see there are no annotations defined for the Object Page ContractItemType entity set in the metadata.xml file, nor local annotations defined in the annotation.xml. That is the reason why you do not see any sections on the Object Page ContractItem.
Please extend your metadata according to the ContractItemType entity set and check the result. If you observe still any issues with missing sections, please send the case back to SAP. Thank you.
For your information, we have observed another issue with local annotations we have generated for your application. This issue hasn't been described by you and is currently being investigated by SAP.

Product Area selected: SAP enhancement package for SAP ERP > Related Products > SAP Fiori for SAP ERP Component selected (Manual Selection): CA-UX-IDE --- Steps to Reproduce --- NOTE TO SAP SUPPORT: I give my approval for SAP Support to reproduce the issue described, while connected to my impacted non-production environments, using any steps provided in the description below or provided later, even if the steps result in a change being made, until the issue is closed. --- Description --- We implemented the below SD Standard Fiori apps few years ago. The customer list on these apps is based on the VE partner function. We already had HCM in our SAP ECC hence we leveraged employee personnel to link Fiori username with customers mapping to the Employee by Partner Function VE. We used the same concept in SAP Plant Maintenance as well to assign the plant work orders.

We are in the process of implementing SuccessFactors and by end of this year, we will be completely out of SAP ECC HCM and moved our workforce/employees to SF. We found a note 2206421 which talks about different options If we don’t have or not implemented HCM. We shall apply that note for now to mitigate the immediate risk. However, would like to understand your road map on such Fiori apps.

As more & more customers like us, are moving out of HCM to SF, what is SAP’s road map for such Fiori apps? Is it continue to use HCM employee data or will there be any integration with SF?

We are also moving from SAP ECC to S/4 HANA next year and as its full of Fiori Apps, are those tightly integrated with employee data of HCM as well?

Solution provided: Hi,
The latest release of our Fiori Tools has a fix to resolve your issue with generating a Fiori application using your SAML destination.
I've confirmed this on the dev space link that was previously provided.
Please let me know if you have any further issues.
Again, sorry for the inconvenience and best of luck with your project.

Attaching MGD_HEC.JPG. Do we need to update the parameter as shown in the screenshot? or do we have to include that in the URL? 2022-10-10 18:43:55 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
Glad to hear local preview is working again.
Even though we have a fix for the wizard issue, it needs more testing as it impacts a number of core flows through the wizard.
Once solution, without having to depend on a fix is to update the destination URL to include the saml:disable param, for example;
http:// : /yourservice/?saml2=disabled
To separate destinations might also be a solution, where you clone your existing destination and have it name appropiately i.e.  with the query string append to the URL.

Thanks. Finally I am able to preview existing applications. Do I have to make similar adjustments for all the applications? Do we have any resolution for the Wizard issue? 2022-10-10 10:04:10 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
My apologies for this, it seems you have exposed another issue in our code; you have two options;
1. update package.json
Open your package.json and change @sap-ux/backend-proxy-middleware to the latest version 0.6.24
run the following conmand to consume the latest locally;
npm i
2. edit the file locally;
/home/user/projects/biorder/node_modules/@sap-ux/backend-proxy-middleware/dist/base/proxy.js
on line 39 change to the following;
if (proxyReq.path?.includes('Fiorilaunchpad.html') && !proxyReq.headersSent) {
This is the original code

Hi,
Using the dev space created for me, I've managed to replicate the local preview issue and hopefully I have a fix for you.
I've attached two files with changes to support 302 redirect with SAML backend;
ui5.yaml - requires a new configuration to support redirects
package.json - requires a new dependency as a devDependency and as a ui5 dependency
Please remove the .txt file extension, this was added to allow upload of these files.
Drop these files into your existing Fiori application and run the following commands;
npm i
- this will regenerate the package-lock and update the node_modules with a new dev dependency
touch .env
- please open this file and append the following text;
FIORI_TOOLS_USER=YOUR_USER
FIORI_TOOLS_PASSWORD=YOUR_PASSWORD

Replace the username and password with your predefined values and start your application as normal, for example:

npm run start

Please let me know if this resolves your issue for local app previewing?


2022-10-05 10:33:31 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
I have indentified the issue with Fiori Tools and consuming your SAML destination. The issue relates to a SAML header that is not being added during the 302 redirect. I have a fix currently being tested which will hopefully be in our next release.
I also looked further into the local preview issue where the application is getting a CORS issue. I've reached out to the team who implemented the local proxy to indentify how we can handle this use as currently the default behaviour in local preview mode is not to follow redirects but instead delegate to the browser which in your case is causing the CORs issue. I will revert back to you once I have a suggestion on how to handle this flow.
 2022-09-30 14:28:43 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
I now have access and have debugged the Fiori Tools issue. Its related to the axios library where its switching between HTTPS_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:8887 which is a HTTPS connection to a non-SSL connection.
I need to investigate further how we can handle this.
We can setup a call next week to determine the issue with your local preview issue.

Attaching the output. Our admin team has provided the access to your ID. Please let me know when you want to set up a call to analyze the issue. 2022-09-29 06:27:39 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
So upon further review it seems there that when running Fiori Tools we are not ignoring insecure certs when moving from a HTTP to a HTTPS endpoint. For example, you are consuming a destination which has a HTTP url but the 302 redirect is then going to a HTTPS endpoint.
Re-run the curl command again with the additional flag -k which ignores insecure certs and will allow this switching from HTTP to HTTPS;
curl -L -k "$H2O_URL/destinations/MGD_HEC/sap/opu/odata/IWFND/CATALOGSERVICE;v=2/ServiceCollection?%24top=1" -vs > curl-top-follow-redirect.txt 2>&1
If you review the output, you should see the response returning a 401 and not a 200 as previously shown.
For more information regarding insecure certs, please read https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/how-to-curl-ignore-ssl-certificate-warnings-command-option/
We have an internal ticket created to understand this flow more and how Fiori Tools can handle this.
 2022-09-28 06:31:29 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Attaching the curl-top-follow-redirect file. I have requested the admin team to provide you the access. Will let you know once done. 2022-09-27 13:14:03 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
Again, there is only two calls in the latest HAR file. Normally for the application to load, it would make over 30-40 calls, for example, it would need to make ui5 calls to load the Fiori Elements modules which in turn would then then make the metadata API calls.
In your latest HAR file, I dont see any console errors and I dont see the metadata call either.
Maybe we can organise a call for Wednesday to review the current situation?

Could you also run this command curl -L "$H2O_URL/destinations/MGD_HEC/sap/opu/odata/IWFND/CATALOGSERVICE;v=2/ServiceCollection?%24top=1" -vs > curl-top-follow-redirect.txt 2>&1
and attach the generated output file.
At this stage it might be worth giving me access to your BAS instance, please add *EMAIL* and I will see if I can re-create the scenarios.

Attached the requested files. 2022-09-27 11:20:01 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
The har files are missing or else empty. The har file should display your local app being loading, consuming the ui5 libraries and also making the metadata call.
You can validate these locally by visiting this website https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/har_analyzer/
Upload your file and it should display the API calls made by your app.
Please re-run again, ensuring you are recording the app loading in your browser.
 2022-09-27 11:14:05 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
Thank you for uploading these files, I will review them shortly.
I've possibly identified the issue with Fiori Tools and why we its not prompting for a username and password, if the CA certs on your Business Application studio are not updated then the proxy will return a 200 instead of forwarding the server. Can you please run this command
curl -L "$H2O_URL/destinations/MGD_HEC/sap/opu/odata/IWFND/CATALOGSERVICE;v=2/ServiceCollection?%24top=1" -vs > curl-top-follow-redirect.txt 2>&1
I need to see what happens when the curl command tries to follow the redirect to the SAML login page.
Please upload curl-top-follow-redirect.txt when the task is completed.
Thanks.

Attaching the Network trace. The cloud connector password which expires annually was reset by the admin team. That is the only change that happened recently that I am aware of. 2022-09-27 09:17:42 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
Thank you for the generated zip, I've changed the destination from MGD_HEC to an internal system and everything works.
To understand why the metadata call is failing, please follow these steps;
A full network trace (.har file) with all requests in the scenario after it was reproduced. How to extract trace follow this note - https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/1990706 and the Browser console logs.
Please provide all the above requested logs in details to analysis the issue further.
Has anything changed on the http://mgd.lexmark.com:8010 backend? Based on your existing issue, when you run the application in local prevew mode, does it prompt for a username and password? If not and it returns a 403 then there must be a configuration change on the backend http://mgd.lexmark.com:8010
Thanks.

The issue is in local preview. The application was running fine 2 weeks back. Attaching the project folder. 2022-09-26 13:23:01 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
Can you confirm if this is in local preview issue or when deployed to ABAP or Cloud Foundry?
A CORS exception normally means your application is making a request to a third party application where the origin is different.
If you supply a sample app I can review your code?
zip -r feproject.zip ./ / -x */\.* *.git \.* *.zip *.env* *.mta *.rb *.bak *.swp *.DS_Store *.back *.merge *.txt *.sh **/resources/\* **/mta-op-*/\* **/gen/\* **/node_modules/\* **/mta_archives/\* **/dist/\* **/.ABAPDeployResources/\* **/.vscode/\*

 2022-09-26 11:27:55 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
For the existing custom applications that were built earlier they are not getting executed. I am getting error messages like:
[ODataMetadata] initial loading of metadata failed Error: HTTP request failed Access to XMLHttpRequest at ____  (redirected from ____ ) from origin  ____ has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
I had attached the screenshot in the ticket at the beginning.(Error.JPG) When we used to run applications it prompted for login credentials. Now it is not doing. Seems like the issue here is similar to the create wizard issue you have raised an internal incident for. 2022-09-26 08:23:04 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
Sorry, what is the issue with the existing applications? The service catalog request with the SAML issue should only block the creation of the application, the application either in local preview mode or when deployed to ABAP or Cloud Foundry should work fine?
I've created an internal issue to track this issue so that we can investigate further why this worked previously but then stopped.
 2022-09-26 07:54:59 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Attaching the files requested. Thanks for the workaround for creating new fiori apps. Is there any workaround to run existing applications? 2022-09-23 14:16:50 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
After reviewing the logs it seems the GET API call we make to validate the destination, is returning a HTTP 200 which is why its not prompting for a username and password; the reason service centre works is because it does a GET API call to retrieve all the services and this call is returning a 401.
Can you please run the following commands;
curl -u 'USERNAME':'PASSWORD' "$H2O_URL/destinations/MGD_HEC/sap/opu/odata/IWFND/CATALOGSERVICE;v=2/ServiceCollection?%24top=1" -vs > curl-withtop-withpass-output.txt 2>&1
curl "$H2O_URL/destinations/MGD_HEC/sap/opu/odata/IWFND/CATALOGSERVICE;v=2/ServiceCollection?%24top=1" -vs > curl-withtop-nopass-output.txt 2>&1
curl -u 'USERNAME':'PASSWORD' "$H2O_URL/destinations/MGD_HEC/sap/opu/odata/IWFND/CATALOGSERVICE;v=2/ServiceCollection" -vs > curl-v2catalog-all-withpass-output.txt 2>&1
curl "$H2O_URL/destinations/MGD_HEC/sap/opu/odata/IWFND/CATALOGSERVICE;v=2/ServiceCollection" -vs > curl-v2catalog-all-nopass-outputt.txt 2>&1
Again, please replace the user/pass where applicable and attach the four generated txt files for review.
A work around to your issue, is to use the Service Centre to select your destation, select your service and then use the Service Actions button to create a Fiori app, this will bypass the Fiori Tools catalog request call that is currently failing for you.
Thanks.

Uploaded the attachments as requested. Let me know if you need any further inputs. 2022-09-23 09:37:30 -  (I313149) (Internal Info)
Current destination configuration;
{ "Name": "MGD_HEC", "Type": "HTTP", "Authentication": "NoAuthentication", "": "OnPremise", "HTML5.DynamicDestination": "true", "Description": "MGD HEC", "HTML5.Timeout": "60000", "WebIDEEnabled": "true", "WebIDESystem": "MGD", "WebIDEUsage": "odata_abap,ui5_execute_abap,dev_abap,bsp_execute_abap,odata_xs,plugin_repository,odata_gen", "Host": "http://mgd.lexmark.com:8010", "WebIDEExposedHost": "mgd.lexmark.com:8010"}
Customer has confirmed there is no username/password prompt and Im not able to reproduce this flow using similiar settings against a test system. 2022-09-23 09:33:12 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
So to confirm, this is the current state of your MGD_HEC destination;
{ "Name": "MGD_HEC", "Type": "HTTP", "Authentication": "NoAuthentication", "": "OnPremise", "HTML5.DynamicDestination": "true", "Description": "MGD HEC", "HTML5.Timeout": "60000", "WebIDEEnabled": "true", "WebIDESystem": "MGD", "WebIDEUsage": "odata_abap,ui5_execute_abap,dev_abap,bsp_execute_abap,odata_xs,plugin_repository,odata_gen", "Host": "http://mgd.lexmark.com:8010", "WebIDEExposedHost": "mgd.lexmark.com:8010"}
The WebIDEUsage does not need odata_gen as these are mutually exclusive when odata_abap is present. Your endpoint is either exposing a catalog of services or a single service, in your case its a catalog of services.
The WebIDEAdditionalData would normally be configured with WebIDEUsage set as odata_gen, if you wanted to expose a single service URL rather than a catalog via a destination configuration.
So the v2 and v4 curl commands require the user/password to be appended based on the 401 unauthorised responses, replace the username and password with the appropiate settings and rerun the command again;
curl -u 'USERNAME':'PASSWORD' "$H2O_URL/destinations/MGD_HEC/sap/opu/odata/IWFND/CATALOGSERVICE;v=2/ServiceCollection?%24top=1" -vs > curl-v2catalog-output.txt 2>&1
Can you please re-attach the updated curl-v2catalog-output.txt please?
Can you please confirm the version of the Fiori Tools generator you are using? I've attached a screen shot to confirm where you obtain this from.
Can you also take a screen shot of the Data Source and Service Selection screen after you have selected the MGD_HEC system? I've attached a screen shot to confirm where you obtain this from.
 2022-09-23 07:00:49 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Yes the destination is configured as NoAuthentication. It was like this from the beginning, still it used to work. I got prompted for login credentials when I ran the Create Project from Template. Now i don't get it now. Even when we tried to run existing Fiori Applications it would prompt for login credentials. It doesn't do it anymore. Attaching the MGD_HEC config. 2022-09-23 06:53:27 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Attaching the files curl-v4catalog-output.txt and curl-v2catalog-output.txt. I am able to access the service from the service center tool. Attaching the screenshots. It is prompting for user ID and password. 2 weeks back when I tried to create new project from template after choosing the destination MGD_HEC the wizard prompted for login credentials. But now it doesn't do it anymore. May be that is why it is not able to fetch the service while running the wizard. Not sure why this happened. I think due to the config parameter WebIDEAdditionalData=full_url I am getting this new error while trying to create a Project from Template:
The destination looks to be mis-configured. Please see https://ga.support.sap.com/dtp/viewer/index.html#/tree/3046/actions/45995:48363:48366 for details on how to configure your destination
I have requested the admin team to remove the parameter. 2022-09-22 13:09:09 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
Thank you for supplying the logs, it seems all the V2 and V4 catalog requests generated by Fiori Tools are returning a 401 for the v2 and 403 for the v4 API requests. This indicates these service requests are not allowed;
https://lexmark-btp.us21cf.applicationstudio.cloud.sap/destinations/MGD_HEC/sap/opu/odata/IWFND/CATALOGSERVICE;v=2/ServiceCollection - Returns a 401
https://lexmark-btp.us21cf.applicationstudio.cloud.sap/destinations/MGD_HEC/sap/opu/odata/IWFND/CATALOGSERVICE;v=2/ - Returns a 401
https://lexmark-btp.us21cf.applicationstudio.cloud.sap/destinations/MGD_HEC/sap/opu/odata4/iwfnd/config/default/iwfnd/catalog/0002/ - Returns a 403
https://lexmark-btp.us21cf.applicationstudio.cloud.sap/destinations/MGD_HEC/sap/opu/odata/IWFND/CATALOGSERVICE;v=2/  - Returns a 403
Your destination is configured with Authentication as NoAuthentication, is this correct? Are these endpoints open and dont require any authentication?
You can validate these reqests yourself by opening a terminal window and running the following commands;
curl "$H2O_URL/destinations/MGD_HEC/sap/opu/odata/IWFND/CATALOGSERVICE;v=2/ServiceCollection" -vs > curl-v2catalog-output.txt 2>&1
curl "$H2O_URL/destinations/MGD_HEC/sap/opu/odata4/iwfnd/config/default/iwfnd/catalog/0002/ServiceGroups?$expand=DefaultSystem($expand=Services)" -vs > curl-v4catalog-output.txt 2>&1
Each of these commands generates a txt file, please refresh your project or your browser to see the file if its not shown in your current directory.
Also, WebIDEAdditionalData=full_url is only required if you are setting up an OData single service destination, in your case the MGD_HEC is configured as an OData ABAP system. Can you explain why you think WebIDEAdditionalData is required?
Another way to validate your destination is to use the Service Centre tool, in Business Application Studio, select the `Service Centre` tab on the left navigation bar, select your destination, if configured correctly, the service and system properties will be returned for your selected destination.
 2022-09-22 09:38:50 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
I have checked the Destination config in BTP. WebIDEEnabled is maintained. But WebIDEAdditionalData=full_url is missing according to the Guided Answers.

Hi,
Please review option 2 on Guided Answers;
https://ga.support.sap.com/dtp/viewer/index.html#/tree/3046/actions/45995:48363:48366
You are missing the WebIDEEnabled flag in your destination properties for MGD_HEC.
Another way to retrieve your services in Business Application Studio, select the `Service Centre` tab on the left navigation bar, select your destination, if configured correctly, the service and system properties will be returned and the services will be listed.
To understand more why the V4 catalog is failing, you can run this command;
curl "$H2O_URL/destinations/MGD_HEC/sap/opu/odata4/iwfnd/config/default/iwfnd/catalog/0002/ServiceGroups?$expand=DefaultSystem($expand=Services)" -vs > curl-v4catalog-output.txt 2>&1
You can review the curl-v4catalog-output.txt output and also attach it to the support ticket for review.
You have also missed a step in the previous post;
Please follow the steps below to capture logs so that you can share them with us:
* Choose File → Preferences → Open Preferences * Search for 'wizard' in the Search Preferences box. * Under Application Wizard: Logging Level, change the dropdown box to be 'trace' * Close the Preferences window. * Re-launch the Fiori Tools generator. * Choose View → Output and choose the log for either Application.Templates or Application.Generators.

Dear Customer,
To start with, can you check if you're able to narrow down your problem following the steps in the Fiori tools Guided Answers here? https://ga.support.sap.com/dtp/viewer/index.html#/tree/3046/actions/45995
If you're still unable to resolve the problem, can you run the command, 'Fiori: Open Environment Check'.
This allows you to:
* check the destination and attach the results as zip to the ticket (replaces the curl commands) * Archive a project to zip (excluding node_modules) to attach it to the ticket
If you're still unable to proceed, please follow the steps below to capture logs so that you can share them with us:
* Choose File → Preferences → Open Preferences * Search for 'wizard' in the Search Preferences box. * Under Application Wizard: Logging Level, change the dropdown box to be 'debug' * Close the Preferences window. * Re-launch the generator. * Choose View → Output and choose the log for either Application.Templates or Application.Generators.
Please provide the full output log into your issue for investigation.

Hi,

The latest release of our tooling has a fix to accomodate the missing build resource attribute. Since the mta was generated outside of our tooling, we are consistently trying to make improvements to ensure that when a Fiori Elements app is appended to an existing mta, that we do some housework to ensure the mta will work.
Please ensure you have the latest version by either creating a new dev space or running `npm i @sap/generator-fiori@latest`.
If you have existing apps, please ensure the mta.yaml has the following attribute `build-result: resources` appended to the deployer resource as shown;

- name: basicmtastandalone_ui_deployer
type: com.sap.application.content
path: .
requires:
- name: basicmtastandalone_html_repo_host
parameters:
content-target: true
build-parameters:
build-result: resources
requires:
- artifacts:
- project1.zip
name: project1
target-path: resources/

Please let me know if you have any futher issues.

Dear ,
I could reproduce the issue internally and saw that we already have an internal ticket for this issue.
I have involved the Fiori Tools colleagues in this investigation.

I would also suggest you look at the managed approuter flow as alternative to standalone, unless you have a specific reason for choosing standalone.

There were issues with your tar/zip file, best practice is to generate an archive using the following command;
zip -r feproject.zip ./ / -x */\.* *.git* \.* *.zip *.env* *.mta *.rb *.bak *.swp *.DS_Store *.back *.merge *.txt *.sh **/resources/\* **/gen/\* **/node_modules/\* **/mta_archives/\* **/dist/\* **/.ABAPDeployResources/\* **/.vscode/\*
Replace ./ / with the path to your project i.e. /home/user/projects/myproject. You dont need the node_modules since you have a package-lock.json which will re-create them locally for us as they need to be generated per OS.
If you are uncomfortable running this command, from SAP Business Application Studio, open command palette via View -> Find Command and enter "Fiori: Open Environment Check" -> Select your specific project. Attach the generated zip to the support ticket.
The referenced blog is using a standalone router, I would suggest you understand the differences between standalone and managed configurations
https://blogs.sap.com/2021/05/17/sap-tech-bytes-faq-managed--vs.-standalone-/
The preferred choice is managed since it removes the dependency on having to maintain your own router and versioning.
Also reviewing your mta.yaml, you have added communitydmadmin- to the resources which is incorrect. The tutorial details adding the destination properties to the existing  where in your case, you have created a new  but which is a module type.
There is also a git reference on the referenced tutorial that has a working configuration.
I would suggest following some additional tutorials to understand how to deploy the different types of configurations.
https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/appstudio-fioriapps-create.html
https://developers.sap.com/group.fiori-tools-lrop.html
Once you have a understood the different configurations, then you can apply the config changes required to introduce the Doc Mgt solution.

Hi,
Based on the attached envcheck there are no destinations configured to return odata services. There is a destination called `abap-cloud-default_abap-green_agrevolution-private-limited_v7bsd57w-2g37xkw-dev` which is pointing to the API zone ap11 which is for token access to services.
When you create a Fiori app you need a datasource i.e. a backend system that will expose a service. If you review the logs in your SAP BTP cockpit -> HTML5 Applications you will see that the endpoint you defined is not accessible.
I would suggest you follow this tutorial ensuring you have a destination exposed;
https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/abap-environment-deploy-cf-production.html
You also need to create a destination that exposes either a catalogue of odata services or a single odata service;
This is a generic tutorial for connecting into Northwind endpoint;
https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/cp-cf-create-destination.html
Here is another for connecting into a ES5 gateway demo system;

Hi, I have created an MTA project and deployed it as well. But, when I am running the app, it's giving me error "Internal Server Error" with status 500. I have attached the "envcheck-2022-07-05T06-08-00.zip" file of MTA project. Kindly help. 2022-08-08 12:38:55 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
There are some additional steps you can perform to help with connection issues on SBAS and will provide output that can be attached here.
Please follow these steps, taken from Guided answers https://ga.support.sap.com/dtp/viewer/index.html#/tree/3046/actions/45995):
Another option is to use SAP Fiori Tools Environment Check;
1. From SAP Business Application Studio, open command palette via View -> Find Command and enter "Fiori: Open Environment Check" -> Enter credentials if prompted -> Choose a location to save
2. A generated "Preview results.md" file is opened. Please check the section "Destination Details". SAP Fiori tools Environment Check will find and suggest if any destination parameters are missing.
3. Now, Log on to the SAP BTP cockpit as an administrator. From your global account, navigate to your Cloud Foundry environment subaccount.
4. In the navigation area, choose Connectivity -> Destinations.
5. Select your destination, and verify that in the "Additional Properties" of your selected destination, you have at least the recommended properties based on the SAP Fiori tools Environment Check.
Please check if these steps help resolve or find the cause of the issue. If not please attach the "envcheck.zip" and we can analyse this and provide further assistance.
Thanks

Hi, The setup of cloud foundry environment and space is done but I am unable to create an mta project in which I can consume my API and repository. In the links provided in previous replies explains creation of mta project using ES5 destination. I was able to create the project with ES5 destination and deployed it as well. But unable to create project to consume my API. Kindly help me with creating one project in which I can consume my API and repository. 2022-07-25 09:21:56 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
There seems to be multiple issues at play here.
1. the mta.yaml is misconfigured - please refer to previous response with links to understanding and generating mta projects
2. Fiori tools is unable to retrieve any ABAP environments, please confirm you have created and assigned a space on your Cloud Foundry environment https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CRQCNwTT0Q
3. Deploy DMS application, this cant be achived until steps 1 and 2 are resolved and your requirements are understood better
Your issues are unrelated to our Fiori Tools component but if you are using Document Management System then I would ask you to refer to their documentation on how to expose the API for consumpation via the SAP BTP cockpit using destinations. Remember, these endpoints i.e. DMS need to be expose via destinations, please refer to ths blog for more info

Hi SAP, This application DMS needs to connect to our DMS repository and in our case we are using BTP as external repository. Please provide the steps to deploy the DMS application on our BTP cockpit and also we need  the code to include our API and repository in the application. Let us know if we can setup a call and resolve the issue. Thanks  2022-07-14 13:15:34 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
There is no error/screen shot/log attach to understand the root cause of your issue.
You are following a blog post that is not related to our Fiori Tools generator so we can only provided limited support.
Here are a number of blogs on how to create mta.yaml with different  configurations;
https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/appstudio-fioriapps-create.html
https://blogs.sap.com/2021/03/03/split-mta-into-backend-frontend-managed-/
Please refer to the previous support responses which have also included additional links for you to consider.
I've aslo added detailed steps to create a basic managed  configuration.
Please beaware, SAP provided consulting support,you can open a new incident, choose the component XX-RC (RC stands for Remote Consulting) and then add the area you are interested in, for example XX-RC-BC. More information is available in SAP Note https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/65864

Detailed steps using Business Application Studio:
Step1. Open the command palette `View` -> `Find Command` a. Enter `Wizard` and select `Open Template Wizard` b Select `Basic Multitarget Application` and press `Next` c. Enter a unique project name, unique within your organisation i.e. the name is used as MTA ID in the `mta.yaml` file
**Note**: SAP Application Studio will restart itself with the new project as root folder
Step2. Right click the newly generated `mta.yaml` and select `Create MTA Module from Template` a. Select ` Configuration` and press `Start` b. Select your HTML5 application runtime `Managed ` c. Enter a unique name for the business solution of the project | Enter a unique ID e.g. ` -service` from step 1.c d. Do you plan to add a UI? `Yes`
Step3. Right click the newly generated `mta.yaml` and select `Create MTA Module from Template` a. Create a `SAP Fiori application` b. Module name: uniquemodulename (make sure its unique in your organisation) c. Namespace: com.hostname d.  Select `Yes` to `Add deployment configuration`, ensuring the newly generated MTA file is selected, refer to next step `Target Name`
Step4. Target Name a. Please choose the target - should default to Cloud Foundry b. Destination name: Keep selected destination, otherwise input a valid destination appropriate for your environment 2022-07-13 11:10:08 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi Team, The blogs provided are not giving the actual solution of the requirement. I am following the blog where Basic MTA application creation is explained.
Integrating SAP CP Document Management Service UI in the Fiori App | SAP Blogs I am unable to follow the steps as the extra coding is giving errors. Basically the requirement is to create an MTA application to consume the API generated in the same blog itself. Could you please provide another blog to follow or explain the steps over a call.

Solution provided: Hi,
There were issues with your tar/zip file, best practice is to generate an archive using the following command;
zip -r feproject.zip ./ / -x */\.* *.git* \.* *.zip *.env* *.mta *.rb *.bak *.swp *.DS_Store *.back *.merge *.txt *.sh **/resources/\* **/gen/\* **/node_modules/\* **/mta_archives/\* **/dist/\* **/.ABAPDeployResources/\* **/.vscode/\*
Replace ./ / with the path to your project i.e. /home/user/projects/myproject. You dont need the node_modules since you have a package-lock.json which will re-create them locally for us as they need to be generated per OS.
If you are uncomfortable running this command, from SAP Business Application Studio, open command palette via View -> Find Command and enter "Fiori: Open Environment Check" -> Select your specific project. Attach the generated zip to the support ticket.
The referenced blog is using a standalone router, I would suggest you understand the differences between standalone and managed configurations
https://blogs.sap.com/2021/05/17/sap-tech-bytes-faq-managed--vs.-standalone-/
The preferred choice is managed since it removes the dependency on having to maintain your own router and versioning.
Also reviewing your mta.yaml, you have added communitydmadmin- to the resources which is incorrect. The tutorial details adding the destination properties to the existing  where in your case, you have created a new  but which is a module type.
There is also a git reference on the referenced tutorial that has a working configuration.
I would suggest following some additional tutorials to understand how to deploy the different types of configurations.
https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/appstudio-fioriapps-create.html
https://developers.sap.com/group.fiori-tools-lrop.html
Once you have a understood the different configurations, then you can apply the config changes required to introduce the Doc Mgt solution.
 2022-06-29 07:42:28 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi , I have attached the project and mta.yaml is already modified with code present in the blog. Regards,  2022-06-28 13:15:43 -  (I515700) (External Info)
Dear customer,
Could you please attach the project for further analysis.
If you run the command
zip -r feproject.zip ./ / -x */\.* *.git* \.* *.zip *.env* *.mta *.rb *.bak *.swp *.DS_Store *.back *.merge *.txt *.sh **/resources/\* **/gen/\* **/node_modules/\* **/mta_archives/\* **/dist/\* **/.ABAPDeployResources/\* **/.vscode/\*
It should only be a few hundred kb's in size as all the node_modules folders and zip/mtar archives are removed. If there are additional files that are taking up space, please include their file extension along with the existing list to be excluded from the zip file.
Kind regards,

Dear Colleagues,
Customer is facing an issue when deploying updates to an existing application in ABAP. When they do this they see the error below:
ERR! builder:custom deploy-to-abap Duplicate Id: Id mandate.zhrman already contained in SAPUI5 Repository ZHR_MAN
From research it seems they need to undeploy and then redeploy the application (case 4273534/2022 for example) however I can see that the error message this customer faces is a bit different.
This case has a duplicate ID message where past cases have a repository already exists message. Further examples of past cases can be seen in the internal pulse reseach
Is the solution the same?
Thanks and

Hello ,
We are trying to use Visual Studio Code without Business Application Studio, this is to create new SAP Fiori test applications.
We need to use Yeoman for development, so we have an issue when we try to connect a new Fiori project built with Yeoman to an SAP Fiori Launchpad's URL.
This problem persists even when we have tried to solve using and installing public web certifications that have been downloaded from our OData web page. Greetings. 2023-02-03 20:49:49 -  (I825228) (External Info)

Product Area selected: SAP Business Technology Platform  > Extension Suite - Development Efficiency  > SAP Business Application Studio Component selected (Manual Selection): CA-BAS-RUN-HTML5 --- Description --- Hello, I am trying to configure a SAPUI5 app for development in BAS. The app is part of a MTA CAP app which has been developed for more than 2 years using WebIDE with the authentication in place. In WebIDE the SAPUI5 app was started with Run as Web Application and was deployed in Cloud Foundry. The SAPUI5 is served by the approuter from localDir webapp (we are not using HTML5 repository service). I followed the Bind a Service to a Locally Run Application So I have bound , destination, connectivity and objectstore services in the .env file. Then I did Create Run Configurations for HTML5 Applications But the run configuration is not working. I added in attachments what I see after I exposed the port, the logs of the debug configuration started and the xs-app.json file. In .env I tried to also add the destinations environment variable because I have 2 environment variable destinations pointing to 2 Node.js apps started locally in BAS. As an alternative, I tried to start the approuter with npm start in a Terminal and added a default-env.json file with the fromated information from .env file and it loads the UI files, but I get 404 from the backend destinations. What do I need in the configuration to make it work with authentication from UI to backend destinations? I attach also a screenshot of the generated HTML5 configuration. Kind regards,

Hi,
Just following up on the issue with configuring the FF(Fiori Freestlye) app to point to a local BAS instance of your CAP project.
First off, are you able to spin up the CAP project and FF app in BAS so that local preview works? i.e. right click on ui and select Preview Application?
Secondly,  I've attached steps that work for a NodeJS app using a Fiori Elements app when deployed to CF but should work for your setup as well or at least give you some indication if something has been missed in your configuration.
I've also attached a sample MTA that works for Java CAP project using a Fiori Elements application when deployed to CF which can be used as a reference as well.
In the documented steps, it using the `cap-launchpad` destination which should be similiar to your `js_be` or `cds_be` destination. A number of the steps can be ignored since you already have an app created and configured and the mta is already generated. Remember, this is configured for one datasource where it seems you have a number of different datasources but should be applicable.
I'm trying to get your app running so I can see what is missing/misconfigured.
Please let me know if you have any questions.
Thanks.

I am also attaching the mta.yaml which we are using in WebIDE. 2021-06-29 08:15:58 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hello , I attached the project code. You will see some tasks and scripts which were our trial of running in VSCode, which was not so successful and you can ignore them. The project has been running in WebIDE successfully for quite a  time. To run in WebIDE you clone the project, then right click on srv folder and Run as Node.js Application, then right click on node folder and Run as Node.js Application, then right click on ui folder and Run as Web Application. Without data in the database it will throw an error in the Home Screen but you will be able to see it load. Let me know if I can provide further information. Thank you, Kind regards,  2021-06-28 17:25:19 -  (I058153) (External Info)

Solution provided: Hi,
Please find the steps below, I would suggest looking at the following site to understand more around mta configurations based on the changes below;
https://help.sap.com/docs/BTP/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/d04fc0e2ad894545aebfd7126384307c.html
In the root of your project, update the package.json to
{ "name": "compati", "version": "0.0.1", "devDependencies": { "rimraf": "3.0.2" }, "scripts": { "undeploy": "cf undeploy compati --delete-services --delete-service-keys --delete-service-brokers", "build": "rimraf resources mta_archives && mbt build --mtar archive", "deploy": "cf deploy mta_archives/archive.mtar --retries 1" } } Next in the same root directory, run the following commands; rm -rf package-lock.json node_modules npm i cd compti rm -rf compti-content.zip npm run deploy-config select Cloud Foundry Select Destination name Test Overwrite xs-app.json No
xs-app.json will not be updated, if you selected Yes then revert to the previous version of your xs-app.json A new ui5-deploy.yaml will be generated in your Fiori UI app.
Next, change back into the root of your project and open mta.yaml, remove the following lines
Lines 45 to 48
- artifacts: - compti-content.zip name: compti target-path: resources/
Lines and 53 to 60 - name: compti type: html5 path: compti build-parameters: builder: custom commands: - npm run build supported-platforms: []
Right click the mta.yaml and build or run the command npm run build. Everything should for you and include any of your changes.
Again, please refer to https://github.com/SAP-samples/fiori-tools-samples/tree/main/cap/cap-fiori-mta/app/feproject-ui for configuration samples.
Please refer to https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/configuring-npm/package-json#scripts to understand how commands are exposed using scripts which help to customise your application.
This site https://developers.sap.com/group.cp-frontend-ui5-1.html is also a great resource to help you understand how to develop and deploy Fiori UI applications to Cloud Foundry.
 2022-08-15 19:53:44 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi, still changes not reflected. could you send me the steps? 2022-08-05 21:32:00 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
I had a quick look at your project and you are not building a fresh zip file of your dist folder. In your compti app folder there is a zip file called compti-content.zip which hasnt been updated since Jan 2022. This is the file that is being used as part of the mta archive generation thus none of your changes will be picked up.
You need to add a zip task as part of the mta.yaml to build the project and to also generate a fresh zip file that will pick up any local changes made.
Please refer to this repo for a better understanding of what is required along with sample package.json scripts in both the root folder and the Fiori UI folder;
https://github.com/SAP-samples/fiori-tools-samples/tree/main/cap/cap-fiori-mta
This should resolve your issue of picking up changes.
 2022-08-03 18:09:43 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi, I attached the information. 2022-08-03 08:41:22 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
I've reviewed the attached zip and it seems its missing some configurations;
1. The project contains an xs-app.json but there is no mta.yaml thus I cant valiate your deployment configuration to CF
2. Your application was created using a Freestyle flow with no datasource. The ui5.yaml contains no backend datasources which means your application will not work in local preview mode since it has no way of retrieving data
3. Based on your attached rebuild test.txt file, the application was built but wasnt deployed? Do you have deployment logs?
4. Can you reference any tutorials that you following?
5. Can you please re-generate the project again excluding the node_modules folder and include the required configuration files
zip -r feproject.zip /home/user/projects/compati -x */\.* *.git \.* *.zip *.env* *.mta *.rb *.bak *.swp *.DS_Store *.back *.merge *.txt *.sh **/resources/\* **/mta-op-*/\* **/gen/\* **/node_modules/\* **/mta_archives/\* **/dist/\* **/.ABAPDeployResources/\* **/.vscode/\*
Alternatively, from SAP Business Application Studio, open command palette via View -> Find Command and enter "Fiori: Open Environment Check" -> Select your specific project. Attach the generated zip to the support ticket
Thanks.  2022-08-03 01:00:35 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
do you have any progress? 2022-07-29 18:48:28 -  (I055995) (External Info)
Dear customer,
I forwarded your ticket to Fiori dev support. Please expect their reply. Thanks and best regards,  2022-07-29 18:42:29 -  (I055995) (Internal Info)
Dear Fiori team,
Customer is performing changes to his Fiori app which is not reflected after deployment. He is also reporting the the run configuration is not working for him so he can't run it in BAS and test there before depoyment.
Please assist him.

Hi colleagues,
Customer has made small changes to a custom Fiori apps View XML. After successful project rebuild and deployment changes do not get replicated on the launchpad, even after cache clearing and Provider Manager .

Dear Colleague,
Please help to check this incident.
Customer tried to deploy application from BAS to backend ABAP system, but failed with error:"*********Cannot get transport configuration from the backend"
It is specifically looking for path /sap/bc/adt/ato/settings and it gives a 403 error.
However they did not find a service in the backend ABAP system with sub-paths under /sap/bc/adt/
For details, please have a look at attahment.
Customer has checked ##2494880.
Could you please help whether no subfolder under /sap/bc/adt is an expected behavior, and how to make /sap/bc/adt/ato/settings active?

Hi , a number of bug fixes related to saved systems and credentials merged in the Fiori tools app generator in the last couple of weeks, so there is a possibility that BAS still had an old version installed. Please let us know if you come across something similar in the future.

Hi, The immediate problem seems to have gone away as suddenly as it started.  I did those steps dozens of times Friday afternoon in both my existing and new Dev Space and always hit the problem shown in the screenshots.  I then tried it Saturday, and the same result.  Now, I just tried it this morning and everything worked just fine.  It also fixed, what I suspected was a related problem when I would try to run the app from BAS. I would still like to know what the problem was, and how I can remediate it when it comes up again. Thanks,  2022-07-02 19:54:42 -  (I848072) (Internal Info)

 2023-01-13 10:22:42 -  (I313149) (External Info)

Hi,
I've reviewed your issue and there are a couple of things you can try to help resolve this;
1. You are using tooling that is not supported by SAP even though it does provide an upload facility. I've followed the referenced blog and in order for me to get a successful deployment working, I had to use the following settings;
{"base": "./dist","conn_usestrictssl" : false,"conn_server": "http://ccw.net.fakedomain:50000/","conn_client" : "100","conn_user": "LONGJO","conn_password": "MyPasswored","conn_password": AGABAP","abap_package": "$tmp","abap_bsp": "ZABAPDEVENT","abap_bsp_text": "Travel APP","abap_transport": ""} The was uploaded as expected to the host system. Please beaware, some of these settings will differ to yours ie. conn_usetrictssl. In your case, you are receiving the error ECONNRESET which indicates something on the server side has closed the connection for some reason.
Are you able to get trace logs on the ABAP system to debug the issue? Refer to this SAP Note https://userapps.support.sap.com/sap/support/knowledge/en/2351619
As a consumer of the nwabap-ui5uploader nodejs package, I would suggest looking at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17245881/how-do-i-debug-error-econnreset-in-node-js#answer-answer-17637900 to debug locally.
2. An alternative is to use the Fiori Tools deployment steps to support ABAP deployment, please refer to the following tutorial for more guidance. https://blogs.sap.com/2020/08/10/sap-fiori-tools-deploy-to-abap-server/
Unfortunately without logs its very difficult the root cause of your issue.

I am happy to announce that version 1.5.5 of @sap/ux-ui5-tooling is now released. The version contains the fix for the issue that you are facing with the "fiori-tools-servestatic" middleware.
Please refer to the updated documentation of the "fiori-tools-servestatic" middleware https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sap/ux-ui5-tooling#configuration-options-1. In your ui5.yaml you need to set "dotfiles: allow".

Dear customer,
thank you for reaching out us. We were able to reproduce the issue. The issue is indeed with the "dotfiles", those files are ignored by the "fiori-tools-servestatic" middleware. We will need to provide a fix for this.
Meanwhile, are you aware that you can also serve local SAPUI5 source directly with the "ui5/cli" as described here https://sap.github.io/ui5-tooling/pages/SAPUI5/? Will this approach work for you?
Thanks and Best Regards,

Dear Experts,
Our customer faced the below problem when developing the UI5 using the visual studio, they attached the their app project and detailed screenshots in the document.

We discussed internally and it seems the path configuration related issue, but have no idea what is the root cause and the fix method for the next step.

So can you help our customer further in the next step?

Thanks a lot for your help,

hi , This works perfectly fine with the changes you made.  Thank You very much for the help. To benefit the SAP community, is it ok if I add these observations about useMockServer, url, -config.js etc. in the post here: sap-fe-mockserver and , any example out there? | SAP Community Thank You, . 2023-02-24 13:01:14 -  (D062812) (External Info)
Hello ,
I was able to make it worked with the attached project. What I needed to do was the following:
1. In the .conf.js I removed the "url" and the "useMockServer" properties. The property "useMockServer" works only with V2 services that it is why it needs to be removed. Furthermore if the "url" property is present, then the middlewares will not be loaded, please see here https://.com/SAP/-ui5#url
2. I fixed the mockserver configuration in the "ui5-.yaml". Please check the attached project.
3. I adapted the path references in the "opaTests.qunit.html". I changed everything from "../../resources/..." to "/resources/..." so that the middleware can handle the requests correctly.
4. Finally in the "ui5-.yaml" I set the UI5 version to latest (the version parameter in ui5 section of the fiori-tools-proxy). in the, because "sap/fe/test/JourneyRunner" is not available in UI5 version.
I am attaching a working version, please try it out and let me know if it works for you.
Best regards,

Please note:  in the manifest.json, the service is at: "mainService": { "uri": "/sap/opu/odata4/sap/ze2e001/default/sap/ze2e001_salesorder/0001/", "type": "OData", "settings": { "annotations": [ "annotation" ], "localUri": "localService/metadata.xml", "odataVersion": "4.0" } } We have tried with other values too, but no luck.   In this repo https://.com/SAP/open-ux-odata/blob/main/samples/function-import/webapp/manifest.json it uses just a string and it is fine. As mentioned earlier, we are using IntelliJ locally for our development. Thank You. 2023-02-23 23:23:51 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
hello , We have tried the mockserver that works with OData v4. However it does not work as expected with  in the mix. For reference, I downloaded the repo https://.com/SAP-samples/fiori-tools-samples, which has a V4/apps/salesorder folder. Installed the node modules etc. and the "int-tests" script works as expected. We can see it is an OData V4 service, and the mockdata is loaded as expected. When we run " start", we end up with a different type of error We have also referenced this link: https://answers.sap.com/questions/13735245/sap-fe-mockserver-and--any-example-out-there.html. Based on what we see, as soon as  comes in, it tries to execute a call for the uri specified in the manifest.json where as the "int-tests" script uses the mockdata xml with no issues. I am attaching the "V4" folder from the fiori-tools-samples repo. Could you please take a look and recommend a solution? Thank You, . 2023-02-19 10:12:53 -  (D062812) (External Info)
Hello ,
thanks for the update. I would also propose to use the property configPath for the  configuration and to set it to "ui5-mock.yaml".

To your question " could you please explain what are you trying to achieve? Do you want to just execute the OPA Tests locally or do you want to execute the OPA Tests by using the  runner? " We want to use , and later on invoke  from a pipeline.  I will use the code here: https://.com/SAP/open-ux-odata/tree/main/samples and update. 2023-02-17 20:28:32 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Thank You  for the reply. I noticed this  issue https://.com/SAP/openui5/issues/2562 and followed it all the way to https://.com/SAP/open-ux-odata/tree/main/samples. Let me try this out. _. 2023-02-17 12:11:23 -  (D062812) (External Info)
Hello ,
could you please explain what are you trying to achieve? Do you want to just execute the OPA Tests locally or do you want to execute the OPA Tests by using the  runner? If you just want to execute the OPA Tests locally then you can use the command "npm run int-test", this will start a local UI5 server with a Mockserver middleware, and will run the OPA Tests.
The mockserver that you are trying to in the  configuration supports only V2 services.
Thanks and Best Regards,

However, from then on, it is no longer possible to refresh the metadata.xml file from the backend using the  in BAS. (it still works in WebIDE in NEO). When clicking the "refresh" icon then fields for client, user and password come up. Enter the client, user and pw of the backend and click the sync button. Today, March 24, it is giving an error "401 invalid authentication". Yesterday, the exact same step was actually giving a "403 not authorized" error. Even asking for the credentials does not make sense since they are maintained in the destination. Screenshot is in _.png. This project () was created in BAS on March 18, so very new. Another project (fvendoraccrual), created a few weeks ago in BAS with project from template, when in Service Manager, even gives the error "Please migrate your project first". See screenshot "fvendoraccrual_..png". Migrate does not make sense since the project was created in BAS. It did not come from WebIDE. Thanks a lot! -

Hi : When I leave user and password empty, and click on SYNC then I get an error "User name or password incorrect. Please try again". This message shows up below the username and password field. Interestingly, last week this particular error message did not come up when leaving the user and password empty. It would just come with a "403 not authorized" (which is different from 401 authentication error that comes today if filling out user/pw/client fields). Please find attached the destination "ECC". It has a user and pw. (with all the authorizations in ECC). 2022-03-24 21:45:55 -  (I829208) (External Info)
Hi ,
We are actively improving the features around Service Manager. We will help you to resolve your issue.
Before we go further, can you please do the following:
1. Even if you see username/password field, can you please click on "sync" button anyways?
2. For the destination in question, can you please goto SAP BTP subaccount page -> then detinations -> then export the destination OR take a snapshot showing the properties set for your destination.

Thanks much.

Hello customer,
Sorry to hear that you are having problems launching the Fiori generator.  It looks like it failed to install in your dev space.  Can you please try the following:

- Click 'View -> Find Command' from the menu and search for `Open Template Wizard`.
- This will show you all the generators that are installed in your dev space.
- 'SAP Fiori application` should be one of the generators installed.  If it is not installed, please check if there is a message at the bottom saying "Generators are being installed in the background", and wait for that to complete.
- If that hasn't resolved your issue, you can open a terminal and type `npm i -g @sap/generator-fiori` and wait for the generator to install.  Then try open the template wizard again.
- If this still doesn't solve your issue, please select `View -> Output` and find the console output when the generator tries to launch.  Please post the console output in this issue for investigation.

Regards,

~~~~Draft to customer~~~
We implemented the plan as shared earlier and we found some notes and findings on issue that relates to this.
The note is: 3063160 - OData version(s): V2, V4, Recommended service: , services unavailable from system: (Attached to this case incident).
It specifies that the Cockpit is trying to reach some oData service and it may seems some destination may be needed to be checked.
There is also some reference link in the note above that may assist tied to destination or you may try this other references that may explain about destination.

Hi,
Can you please specify your requirement? Is it to expose an OData Service or to expose an OData Catalog? Each destination will expect a certain set of properties to be defined to reflect the different types;
If running on Business application studio, open a new terminal window and execute the following commands, replacing with the name of your destination;
To see a list of available destinations, run the following command;
curl $H2O_URL/api/listDestinations
Also, if authentication is required for your specific destination, please add the user:pass to each curl command i.e. curl -u : "$H2O_URL/destinations/ /$metadata"

Validate OData Service destination
Run command:
curl "$H2O_URL/destinations/ /$metadata"
If you expose an OData Service destination then the URL in the destination needs to have the full path to the exposed service i.e. https://services.odata.org/V2/Northwind/Northwind.svc/ - please note the https as well and the full path to the individual service
`WebIDEUsage` would then have `odata_gen` defined since and `odata_abap` is not applicable here. `WebIDEAdditionalData` would have `full_url` defined as well.
There are three ways to validate the OData Service destination;
1. In Business Application Studio, select the `Service Centre` tab on the left navigation bar, select your destination, if configured correctly, the service and system properties will be returned
2. Open the command palette `View` -> `Find Command` -> `Fiori: Open Application Generator`, Create a `SAP Fiori application`, Select `Connect to an OData Service` and enter the full url to the service, the `Next` button should be enabled indicating the service has been returned correctly
3. Open the command palette `View` -> `Find Command` -> `Fiori: Open Application Generator`, Create a `SAP Fiori application`, Select `Connect to a System`, select your destination and the service name should be able in the dropdown menu
Please refer to https://github.com/SAPDocuments/Tutorials/blob/master/tutorials/cp-connectivity-consume-odata-service-approuter/cp-connectivity-consume-odata-service-approuter.md for more details

Validate OData Catalog destination (V2 and V4)
Run command(s):
V2
curl "$H2O_URL/destinations/ /sap/opu/odata4/iwfnd/config/default/iwfnd/catalog/0002/ServiceGroups?$expand=DefaultSystem($expand=Services)"
curl "$H2O_URL/destinations/ /sap/opu/odata/IWFND/CATALOGSERVICE;v=2/ServiceCollection"
V4
curl "$H2O_URL/destinations/ /sap/opu/odata4/iwfnd/config/default/iwfnd/catalog/0002/ServiceGroups?$expand=DefaultSystem($expand=Services)"
However, if you are exposing an OData Catalog destination, then the steps are similar; For example, the destination needs to have the host; https://myapp.abap.staging.hanalab.ondemand.com please note the https as well. `WebIDEUsage` would then have `odata_abap,dev_abap,abap_cloud` and `WebIDEAdditionalData` can be removed since it’s not applicable for a catalog endpoint.

There are two ways to validate the OData Catalog destination;
1. In Business Application Studio, select the `Service Centre` tab on the left navigation bar, select your destination, if configured correctly, the service and system properties will be returned and also indicate if the V2 and V4 services are available
2. Open the command palette `View` -> `Find Command` -> `Fiori: Open Application Generator`, Create a `SAP Fiori application`, Select `Connect to a System`, select your destination a list of services should be exposed

Please refer to Step5 - Create IAM App and business catalog to ensure the catalog is exposed correctly

Hi , Thanks for your support .Will wait for the response from the BTP .Hope they will contact me soon.As I am not able to start Fiori developments because of this issues. Regards  + 2021-08-09 15:19:06 -  (I834260) (Internal Info)
Dear CA-UX-IDE team,
This is a handover from CA-UI5-COR on an issue tied to the SAP Business Application Studio having issues connecting to the cloud via some services.
Per our initial analysis, we did the analysis and placed it in the Pulse (Summary) Internal investigation.
At best we provided to the customer this SAP note:
3063160 - Odata Versions: V2, V4 Recommended service - services unavailable from system: which is under component CA-UX-IDE.
From the above, it is authored by CA-UX-IDE on why the services is not available.
From what we gather, there is a service that the SAP Business Application is calling that does not seem to be a service as the XML is not being returned per the note shared above.
This is as far as we helped the customer as we believed that it was an issue that was opened in the wrong component (libraries UI5) versus the SAP Business Application and how it works with BTP (Technology Platform).
So at best we believed that CA-UX-IDE or the cloud foundry contacts that you have may know it.
We tried to share your notes and the customer needs more assistance tied to the 3rd service that is failing when SAP Business Application studio is calling it.
"https://cengdevs4.cairnindia.com:1443/sap/opu/odata4/iwfnd/config/default/iwfnd/catalog/0002/ "
Again it is related to the note we shared above and it will be ideal if the author of the note reviews this issue "3063160 ".
Regards,

Imran and team,
Hello and here is the update.
Per your latest statement and suggestion.
I would like to propose that I would involved our BTP - technology platform team to do further analysis on this case as we in the CA-UI5-COR our all library runtime and this issue is strictly tied to the actual Cloud Platform.
Please stand by while I get a resource to assist to determine the cause and we appreciate your time that you spent with us on this part. Our first attempt to assist is to give the team some know how from our records and now it may need more in-depth key experts to assist.
Please hold while I get it to the correct team.

Hi , I understand there is a configuration issue. But that's the reason we raised it to SAP. As from my end I am sure that the configuration is fine.Even though I guide my colleague to do same configuration and that's working for him. 1. I have configured the cloud connector on my local system and the same is working fine. 2. the Singapore and UAE related ip's are already whitelisted . I confirmed by doing telnet . 3. Cloud foundry destination is also maintained. But still we are getting this error. At least guide us how we can check the logs to find out the root cause. Regards  + 2021-08-03 15:49:58 -  (I834260) (External Info)
Imran,
This is how I am reading the newly presented case or report.
You have 2 services that returns proper XML.  This means that this services are configured correctly.
For the purpose of comparison you need to document or expose to SAP what are these services for future discussion.
You have a 3rd service that is failing on this link:
https://cengdevs4.cairnindia.com:1443/sap/opu/odata4/iwfnd/config/default/iwfnd/catalog/0002/
If we look at the link above, it may not be a valid service as it is pointing to a catalog 0002.  A typical service may be a services type of format.  This is the reason you may share the URL of the 2 services that is being called as the format of the above appears not to be a valid service.  The team may need to state which documentation was used to specify those services.
From what I can tell this could be a configuration issue as the services that the team is trying to reach is not available hence the error of the backend that claims that the services is not registered per your error.  For now, I believe that you need to follow the steps of the first two URL and look at the URL syntax.
This issue is appearing more of a BTP connectivity issue and the service being called is probably unconfigured correctly.
This is what we can share.

Hello. It appears the editors or authors may be adding more information to help improve it. For now, I am pasting the contents below + adding the attachment from the note to this case as reference to speed up the knowledge share.
~~~~From KBA note 3063160~~~~

Symptom

The following error occurs after selecting the system for data source in Fiori application template:
All catalog service requests failed for system: /. OData version(s): V2, V4.

Environment

SAP Business Application Studio
Fiori Tools application template
ABAP gateway or S/4 Hana system.

Reproducing the Issue

Create destination in SAP BTP cockpit for backend data source service Start Business Application Studio Choose "Fiori" dev space Start from template Select "SAP Fiori" application and press Start Select any of freestyle or  template As Data source select "Connect to an SAP System" Select your system

Cause

BAS Fiori application template tries to reach the following two URLs with a GET request and shows this error if 404 Unavailable is returned:
/sap/opu/odata/IWFND/CATALOGSERVICE;v=2/ServiceCollection?%24top=1
/sap/opu/odata/IWFND/CATALOGSERVICE;v=2/
/sap/opu/odata4/iwfnd/config/default/iwfnd/catalog/0002/

Resolution

Make sure that valid XML is returned from either of the following two URLs:
/sap/opu/odata/IWFND/CATALOGSERVICE;v=2/ServiceCollection?%24top=1
/sap/opu/odata/IWFND/CATALOGSERVICE;v=2/
/sap/opu/odata4/iwfnd/config/default/iwfnd/catalog/0002/
Use the username and password configured in the destination while testing the above URLs.

In case you are using SAP Cloud Connector, please:
Use the internal host mapped to the destination URL instead of the URL from the destination and test this from inside the corporate network where SAP Cloud Connector is installed. Make sure that your connectivity to the backend is configured according to the following documentation: Connecting to External Systems Make sure to expose the path "/sap/opu" with "Path And All Sub-Paths" as per the following documentation: Configure Access Control (HTTP) Make sure that the SAP Cloud Connector's host is able to communicate with the Business Application Studio endpoints, according to this documentation: SAP Business Application Studio Availability

If your backend system is S4HANA, please use a odata service URL instead of the catalog, as explained in the attached document "App Studio - Configuring a destination and service path (destination host & service url).docx".

Dear customer,
Can you tell us which version of Fiori generator you are using? You should be able to get the version number by running the following command on a terminal. npm list -g | grep @sap/generator-fiori
Meanwhile, can you manually type your transport number in ui5-deploy.yaml file and save it. You should be able to continue the deploy process.

Dear colleagues,
This issue appears to be on the BAS side, and I am not sure of the component but when i searched on the yaml and the words transport request, your team came up most.   Can you please assist or route this to the appropriate BAS team.
All the best
 2022-06-27 11:00:43 -  (I825982) (External Info)
Dear customer,
I am going to move this over to the correct component for further handling.
All the best,

We are currently migrating our project from Web IDE to Business Application Studio and have encountered some connectivity problems.
When trying to handle a request to a third-party application (an ajax call, for example) from a local application (not deployed to CF), the request is not going through and we receive a 404 error message (see attachment).

Hi,
Yes we can organise a screen sharing session. I'm on annual leave tomorrow but we can organise today Monday 19th before 17hrs GMT +1 or anytime on Wed/Thurs/Fri. My email is *EMAIL*.
If your destinations are not shown, please ensure you have configured the destinations correctly on your SAP BTP account, follow option 2 in this guide;
https://ga.support.sap.com/dtp/viewer/index.html#/tree/3046/actions/45995:48363:48366
As regards your ui5.yaml, you dont have the path defined correcftly. YAML requires certain tabs to be in place, I've attached a sample for you, pleas rename file to ui5.yaml from ui5.yaml.txt.
 2022-09-19 11:03:19 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi,
Yes, our issue is happening when we are trying to run our application locally in Business Application Studio. I open the Environment Check, but it seems it doesn’t find any destinations (see error_4.png).
I also added what you suggested to the ui5.yaml and manifest.json files but for the ui5.yaml we have the following errors (see error_5.png).
I assume I did not configure something correctly here. Please let me know. They were added like this (see error_6.png error_7.png). Maybe it would be good to have a short teams session to show it quickly. Best regards  2022-09-15 15:06:27 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
Just to be clear, your issue is related to local preview? Based on the screenshots its an issue with starting your app locally in Business Application Studio?
However, xs-app.json is routing to handle API requests when deployed to Cloud Foundry? Your xs-app.json looks correct.
In SAP Business Application Studio, open command pallete via View->Find Command and enter "Fiori: Open Environment Check" -> select "View results". This will generate a report which will also list all the destinations.
The output will validate your SPARC_IMAGEMASTER is configured correctly. Please attach to the support ticker for review.
To ensure you have the correct ui5.yaml/ui5-local.yaml which is read when running in local preview mode, please ensure you have the following configured;

- path: /SPARC_IMAGEMASTER
destination: SPARC_IMAGEMASTER
url: "https://www.google.com"
pathPrefix: /

Depending on your version of ui5-tools, if pathPerfix is not working, replace this with pathReplace: /, for example:

- path: /SPARC_IMAGEMASTER
destination: SPARC_IMAGEMASTER
url: "https://o1addonskiaxrlage7.eu2.hana.ondemand.com/O1SUPPORT/DEV/Service.xsodata"
pathReplace: /

These configs assume your manifest.json datasource is configured as;

"mainService": {
"uri": "/SPARC_IMAGEMASTER/sap/opu/odata/dmo/API_TRAVEL_U_V2/",
"type": "OData",
"settings": {
"annotations": [
"annotation"
],
"localUri": "localService/metadata.xml",
"odataVersion": "2.0"
}
},

If your URI is configured in the manifest as;

"uri": "/sap/opu/odata/dmo/API_TRAVEL_U_V2/"

Then your ui5 yaml files will have;

- path: /sap
destination: SPARC_IMAGEMASTER
url: "https://www.google.com"

Please let me know the outcome of these changes.

Dear Customer, Thanks for contacting SAP Product Support. Regarding this issue, I will involve my colleague from CA-UX-IDE team to check further. You will be updated shortly. Best regards,  2022-09-15 14:38:05 -  (I513711) (Internal Info)
Dear Collegue, Could you please help to check this incident?
For that API call we use the Image Master (on-premise system) destination which is configured as a global destination in the BTP Cockpit (see attachment).
And in our application we have it configured in xs-app.json in the ui module like this:
{

"source": "^/SPARC_IMAGEMASTER",

"target": "/",

"destination": "SPARC_IMAGEMASTER",

"csrfProtection": false
}

Trying to delete the leading slash like mentioned by you did not work. We think that the destinations are not visible from Business Application Studio and therefore cannot be used. Here is the guide for Migrate SAP Fiori projects from SAP Web IDE to SAP Business Application Studio. Could you please help to check it from CA-UX-IDE perspective? Best regards,  2022-09-14 14:58:21 -  (I320514) (Internal Info)
Dear Colleagues,
When customer is previewing his app in BAS, the Destinations URL is not called, causing the request to fail.

Hi , Thanks for the clarification. We tried restarting the Dev space multiple times yesterday but Open environment check was not available. Upon restarting the Dev space today, Open environment check is available once again and yes, we had validated the V4 services from Service centre yesterday. Could you please provide the use cases for dev_abap and ui5_execute_abap in the destinations? Can they be appended along with odata_abap. Thanks for your support, Appreciate it. Regards, Arun 2022-05-12 21:30:40 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
Glad the V4 services issue was resolved.
As regards the Open Environment check, this is normally accessed from View->Find Command and enter "Fiori: Open Environment Check" -> select "View results".
Can you confirm this is no longer showing? It can sometimes take a few minutes for all the extensions to be loaded fully in your BAS environment, try refreshing the browser to validate if this is still the case.
You can also access your destination via the service centre, select the `Service Centre` tab on the left navigation bar, select your destination, if configured correctly, the service and system properties will be returned and also indicate if the V2 and V4 services are available.
I'm reducing the priority from a High as the V4 issue is no longer a blocker for you. Please feel free to reset the status if the priority does not reflect your needs.

Switching to OPU-GW-V4 component as Fiori Tools does not have the experience to resolve this customers issue.
I will monitor the ticket so that I can track the solution which can be used to resolve further issues that are assigned to our component. 2022-05-12 10:24:30 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
In order to resolve your issue with v4, I will need to re-assign your ticket to another component who will have more knowledge in this area.
I know from experience, they will require cloud connector logs, this can be achieved by following this guide
Provide Cloud Connector logs (ljs_trace.log) containing the same time frame issue was reproduced, as seen in the error where the V4 catalog fails i.e. running the environment check. https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2452568

Hi , 1. SICF is activated and /sap/opu/odata4/ resource is exposed in cloud connector 2. Provided user ID is an admin ID and has complete authorizatons. 3. V2 services are working as expected, No issues with them. 4. We would like to understand, why V4 catalog services status is not available. Regards, Arun 2022-05-11 15:27:00 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
So we have goodish news! This indicates that the V4 service is either not exposed via your cloud connector or the user/sap-client does not have the correct privileges to call the V4 catalog.
However, you can create a partial destination to handle only the V2 services.
Login to your SAP BTP account Select your subaccount Select Destinations Clone the existing DS4_DEV_S4HANA Update the name to suite your requirement ie. DS4_DEV_S4HANA_V2 Change the WebIDESystem from odata_abap to odata_gen Update the host/URL to http://vhsegds4ci.sap.future.smart.com:44300/sap/opu/odata/sap/
You now have a partial destination created. What does partial destination mean?
This will now allow you to use our Fiori Tools application generator, when you select the destination DS4_DEV_S4HANA_V2, it will prompt you for the service path ie. API_PRODUCTION_ORDER_2_SRV or what ever service you want to use. Depending on paths and how your backend is configured you can try with a leading slash ie. /API_PRODUCTION_ORDER_2_SRV if there are errors with retrieving the host. This will return the service metadata and allow you to create a Fiori Elements application.
You can also validate this working correctly by using the following curl command;
https://$H2O_URL/destinations/DS4_DEV_S4HANA_V2/sap/opu/odata/sap/ReplaceWithTheNameOfYourService/
This should return a valid HTTP 200 response along with data.
Another option, in SAP Business Application Studio, select the `Service Centre` tab on the left navigation bar, select your destination, if configured correctly, the service and system properties will be returned for the V2. This will also allow you to create a Fiori application by clicking Service Action from this tool.
Please let me know if this resolves your issue for consuming V2 services.
In relation to your 403 V4 catalog error, there is an SAP article around this https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/0002954378 and https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/0002928752 which refers to activiting sap/opu/odata4 ICF node through SICF t-code. If this is not feasible, then the V2 steps should resolve your issue.
 2022-05-11 13:39:40 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Dear , We have enabled the proxy and V2 services are connecting from On-Premise. However for V4 services, still it is throwing error. Attaching the open environment check for your reference. Could you please help us here. Regards, Arun 2022-04-29 19:04:52 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
Please ensure there are no issues with a corporate firewall/proxy or web filters, please refer to https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/3035686 for more info. Some corporate firewalls or web filters may block the Cloud Connector from connecting SAP Business Application Studio and the on-premise system. SAP Business Application Studio needs to connect to the SAP HANA Cloud instance where you want to deploy your application’s database artifacts. By default, SAP HANA Cloud accepts all connections from allowed IP addresses in SAP BTP, for example, in the same region and infrastructure where SAP HANA was provisioned.
If you are working on an Azure account or you are trying to connect an SAP HANA instance from a different region, you must configure SAP HANA Cloud to allow connections from the IP address hosting SAP Business Application Studio for your Cloud region and the underlying platform.
To learn how to change the SAP HANA Cloud allowed connections, see Change Allowed Connections [https://help.sap.com/viewer/db19c7071e5f4101837e23f06e576495/2020_04_QRC/en-US/770d34deb86d4eb49dc944ce9921228c.html].
To find out your SAP Business Application Studio IP address, see SAP Business Application Studio availability  [https://help.sap.com/doc/47f5ed8a96a04b619d3c1724922b4151/Cloud/en-US/Wing_public.pdf#page=153&zoom=100,0,329] page 153.
I hope this answers your question re firewalls and proxies.
Another suggestion is call the destination directly to ensure there are no issues with firewalls/proxies on Business Application Studio, however, your onpremise backend could still be blocking requests, please speak with your IT admin regarding this matter. To call the destination directly, please follow these instructions;
To independently validate your SAP BTP destination configuration, follow these steps;
Note: Please ensure you have subscribed to the Launchpad Service before proceeding
1. In your SAP BTP Cockpit, select your subaccount overview page
2. Note the `Subdomain` attribute i.e. `my-subdomain`
3. Note the `API endpoint` attribute i.e. https://api.cf.eu10.hana.ondemand.com thus the region in this case will be `eu10`
4. Select `Destinations` under `Connectivity` tab on the left navigation bar
5. Filter the destinations using the name of your chosen destination
6. Select your destination i.e. `MyDestination`
7. Select `Edit`
8. Set the following `Additional Properties`, if not already set;
HTML5.DynamicDestination: true
WebIDEEnabled: true
9. Select `Save`, please ensure you have the client secret if required
10. Generate the link as follows, replacing the four values as follows;
https://.launchpad.cfapps..hana.ondemand.com/dynamic_dest/ /
For example:
Single OData Service
https://my-subdomain.launchpad.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/dynamic_dest/MyDestination/sap/opu/odata/sap/My_Business_Service/$metadata
Replace `My_Business_Service` with the specific name of your OData Service
OData Catalog V2
https://my-subdomain.launchpad.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/dynamic_dest/MyDestination/sap/opu/odata/IWFND/CATALOGSERVICE;v=2/ServiceCollection
OData Catalog V4
https://my-subdomain.launchpad.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/dynamic_dest/MyDestination/sap/opu/odata4/iwfnd/config/default/iwfnd/catalog/0002/ServiceGroups?$expand=DefaultSystem($expand=Services)
11. Open a new browser tab, to validate the URL is working i.e. assuming its an OData Service, XML should be returned

Hi , As suggested, we removed the odata_gen from the destination and cloud connector configuration, resources are exposed as expected. HTTP 503 is still occurring, could it be because of the PROXY? (Attached the FIORI tools output for your reference) Does the SAP BAS application requires to be whitelisted in PROXY? Kindly confirm. Regards, Arun 2022-04-29 15:14:20 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
Based on your response, your DS4_DEV_S4HANA destination is configured with the following properties;
odata_abap,dev_abap,odata_gen,ui5_execute_abap
Its also returning a HTTP 503 which indicates the endpoint is not exposing a catalog of OData services as shown in the word doc.
Can you confirm your requirement? To expose a catalog of services or a single service destination?
You need to understand if your endpoint is exposing a catalog of OData services ie. odata_abap or exposing a single service i.e. odata_gen. However the destination cannot expose both as these are mutually exclusive.
A couple of references for you to understand the distinction;

Hi , "So I guess you will come up with a fix that would display an error when attempting to deploy against a service protected by SAML." This fix has been picked for the next release. You should be able to see error message indicating unsupported SAML authentication with the next ui5 tooling lib release. You can upgrade it by the following in a terminal: 1. Goto your project folder 2. delete package-lock.json file 3. run npm install For your latest question about different authentication behavior in app generator and deploy:  I checked our Fiori generator implementation. It is different from deployment. Some destinations like yours are configured to support SAML and also basic auth as a fallback. When you see the username/password field, Fiori generator already received an SAML response and continue to prompt username/password fields as a best effort attempt to try basic authentication. However, this implementation in Fiori generator might not be ideal in some other scenarios. We are investigating what is the best option to handle SAML authentication and once decided, we will make sure the same behavior will be implemented in both Fiori generator and deployment. Best regards,

Hi . That is correct - the two destinations works the same. And I can load list of OData services (using either destination) from the templates in vscode, just by providing username/password (no SAML configured). However for deploy and local testing I must use alternative service paths configured for Basic Authentication and not SAML. ,   2021-06-24 17:21:17 -  (I830561) (External Info)
Hi ,
Thanks for the answer. So you are saying TOPDK_UDV_100 and SAP_UDV_100 have same  in both app generator authentication in vscode and in the CLI deployment? I.e. both destinations authenticates fine in vscode, but need to use alternative service path in ui5-deploy.yaml config for authentication during deployments? Best regards,  2021-06-24 06:54:55 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi . There is no (real) difference between the two (I have added export of both). SAP_UDV_100 is just setup against a new Cloud Connector using virtual host 'sapudv' instead of physical hostname. But still is a 'plain' destination with NoAuthentication. , Søren 2021-06-23 14:37:50 -  (I830561) (External Info)
Hi ,
In the screenshot, the destination is different i.e. SAP_UDV_100. In the previous screenshot you provided for the deploy issue, you used destination TOPDK_UDV_100. Is it possible the destinations are configured differently? Have you tried to use SAP_UDV_100 for deploying? Does it require customized "service" parameter in ui5-deploy.yaml, or it accepts basic authentication without "service" parameter?
Best regards,
 2021-06-18 11:46:56 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi . One thing I have been wondering about, is the fact that the BAS Template for 'Fiori Worklist App', I can call the SAML protected resouces (/sap/opu/odata/..) even when no SAML has been configured. I am still using the destination with 'NoAuthentication'. The wizard (check attached picture) prompts me for credentials that are used. This must mean the Basic Authentication is actually being used against SAML protected resources. In the browser I can do the same with URL parameter 'saml2=disabled', so this is no surprise in itself. Only that it is done elsewhere in BAS. ,   2021-06-15 08:55:47 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi . You should now have been provided credentials for a user with a Developer Key, so you can test deployment for yourself. Please let me know if you need anything else. ,   2021-06-11 16:56:19 -  (I830561) (External Info)
Hi ,
I am glad deployment worked out for you. "So I guess you will come up with a fix that would display an error when attempting to deploy against a service protected by SAML." Yes I will work on capturing the SAML response and display error message. I can get to this point in your SBAS dev account without a dev user on the on-premise backend. It would be great if you can keep my access to your SBAS account for a few more days, so that I can test my fix. Best regards,
 2021-06-11 15:44:30 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi . I did request a user for you to test the deployment procedure (on Topdanmarks ABAP system) Do you still think this is relevant for you ? , Søren 2021-06-11 15:10:59 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi . I have now tested a little more thoroughly, and I can confirm that deployment is actually working both for credentials in'.env' file and with credentials being set as environment variables. What I think I did wrong in my first test, was to think that environment variables were shared across terminal windows, which does not seem to be the case. So one must make sure to deploy in the same terminal window as setting the environment variables. I actually created a small script (my first) to prompt for credentials and then execute 'npm run build' and 'npm run deploy'. This works perfectly. (I attached it to this incident). And I don't need to store my credentials anywhere :-) And I previously tested using the '.env' file. So all in all, I am happy now. So I guess you will come up with a fix that would display an error when attempting to deploy against a service protected by SAML. Thanks for the help. ,   2021-06-11 15:03:33 -  (I830561) (External Info)
Hi ,
Thanks for confirming .env works for you. I also tested setting environment variable by using export in the terminal. This should also work. It might be possible there is a small mistake when you set export env var. Please take a look at the attached screenshot where I provided an example of how I did it. You can verify the input value by running printenv command. Text version: user: zls21060202 $ export XXTOPDK_UDV_USER=LINSHEN user: zls21060202 $ export XXTOPDK_UDV_PW=123456 user: zls21060202 $ printenv XXTOPDK_UDV_USER LINSHEN user: zls21060202 $ printenv XXTOPDK_UDV_PW 123456 user: zls21060202 $ Best regards,

Hi . I just tested providing credentials via commands: - export XXTOPDK_UDV_USER= - export XXTOPDK_UDV_PW= And this does NOT seem to work. So it seems that credentials can only be set via .env file. But as I said I will do more thorough testing on monday. ,   2021-06-11 06:51:22 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi . It actually DOES work. With all the different combinations I tried, I think I may not have tried providing credentials AND setting the "service: /odata/UI5/ABAP_REPOSITORY_SRV". But I can confirm that this combination actually works, and I can now deploy successfully to the OnPremise ABAP system. I have other obligations today, but I will test this more thoroughly on monday at the latest. Thanks,   2021-06-10 16:48:02 -  (I830561) (External Info)
Hi , "Do you mean, that by providing  "service: /odata/UI5/ABAP_REPOSITORY_SRV" it should actually work now ?" Didn't you try it already, but still didn't work? I was expecting the following combination to work, by using "service: /odata/UI5/ABAP_REPOSITORY_SRV". But you said it still shows successful message with nothing deployed. - In ui5-deploy.yaml, enable "service: /odata/UI5/ABAP_REPOSITORY" as you did before. - In ui5-deploy.yaml, keep the credentials parameters you had before. - Under the project root folder (folder that contain package.json, ui5-deploy.yaml, etc), create an .env file. 2021-06-10 15:20:31 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi . Statement: "I tried creating the .env file... But it did not work either." Answer: I got no errors at all, so same as before. It states successful deployment, but nothing was deployed. Statement: "...our tool correctly identifies basic authentication..."Question: Do you mean, that by providing  "service: /odata/UI5/ABAP_REPOSITORY_SRV" it should actually work now ? Thanks,   2021-06-10 15:02:52 -  (I830561) (External Info)
Hi ,
Yes, this is from . Thank you very much for providing access to your SBAS environment. I can access the system now. I can explain why the default service path "/sap/opu/odata/UI5/ABAP_REPOSITORY_SRV" showed successfully but no content was deployed. It is because we don't support SAML authentication yet. When this service path is used, a SAML authentication response is returned from backend. This http response has normal http code 200. Our tool treated it as a successful response, but actually no deployment was executed. "I tried creating the .env file... But it did not work either." What was the actual error you have? Did you get 401 Unauthorized error for this? Once I have a user for the backend system from you, I will also test. For now, I can see when "service: /odata/UI5/ABAP_REPOSITORY_SRV" is used, our tool correctly identifies basic authentication is required and picks up this service path for request url. Best regards,
 2021-06-10 07:08:21 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi . I tried creating the .env file (eventhough I hate this kind of approach - it is very insecure, that you need to store your credentials in clear text - I never want to do that !). But it did not work either. ,   2021-06-10 06:52:25 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi  (I assume it is you). I will try your suggestions. Your user *EMAIL* has been authorized as BAS_Developer on the CF subaccount. BAS URL: https://topdk-sandbox.eu20cf.applicationstudio.cloud.sap/index.html I will request a backend user for you. This will be registered on this OSS by the Basis team. I have downloaded and attached a copy of my BAS project (I removed the nodes_modules and dist folders). PS: Please note that the SCC for this subaccount is running on my Topdanmark virtual PC, but I will keep it running 24/7 for some days. ,   2021-06-09 18:33:00 -  (I830561) (External Info)
Hi ,
Please see my last message for the instructions. This message is just some details I would like to add to the original instructions. - For request access your SBAS dev account. I will also need a valid user credential for testing on-premise deployment. - For the test I would like your to try, please provide your username and password in the .env file. No quote is required on the text. E.g.
XXTOPDK_UDV_USER=
XXTOPDK_UDV_PW=123456 I saw you were using XXTOPDK_UDV_USER and XXTOPDK_UDV_PW already in credentials config in ui5-deploy.yaml already. So these two variable name should be the same in .env file. Please make sure the variable names are the same in ui5-deploy.yaml and .env. if you changed the variable name at either places. 2021-06-09 18:07:08 -  (I830561) (External Info)
Hi ,
Thank you very much for showing the error scenario in the call today. It helped to narrow down the space we need to explore. Can I request to access your SBAS dev account? I will need to test something to confirm my guesses. Meanwhile, could you try this combination and let me know the outcome of running "npm run deploy": - In ui5-deploy.yaml, enable "service: /odata/UI5/ABAP_REPOSITORY" as you did before. - In ui5-deploy.yaml, keep the credentials parameters you had before. - Under the project root folder (folder that contain package.json, ui5-deploy.yaml, etc), create an .env file. This file should contain the following text: XXTOPDK_UDV_USER=
XXTOPDK_UDV_PW=
2021-06-08 16:20:07 -  (I830561) (External Info)
Hi ,

The credential shouldn't be required since you are on SBAS. The successful log screenshot you provided before indicates authenticate was successful and connection has been established without basic auth and credential configuration in ui5-deploy.yaml. It is probably easier to have a call to investigate why the log showed successful but you found no content.  from our team will send you a meeting request for tomorrow. Best regards,
 2021-06-08 08:32:30 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
One more thing: I have setup the gateway trace (/IWFND/TRACES) to track my requests to the Repository service, but I am not seeing any calls being made. For the abap-deploy routine I can trace the calls. ,   2021-06-08 08:29:45 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi . I have done some more testing on this. I found that there was a credentials segment, that needs to be in place for deployment from BAS. Here one needs to pass credentials via environment variables (I still much prefer to be prompted like in abap-deploy - but right now I am just focused on getting this to work). I have uploaded two screendumps of separate attempts on setting this and trying to deploy. None of them are working, eventhough the default one, says it was deployed. Please note that the default path /sap/... is using SAML in the backend, while the alias /odata/... is using Basic Authentication. That is why I am using the latter for the basic test. However the deployment procedure for abap-deploy does require this specification, and it still works, so I am not sure if it is needed. Thanks,   2021-06-08 06:51:41 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi . I can say for sure, that nothing was deployed. I can also say, that what you mention about authentication makes no sense at all. I authenticate to BAS using my S-user (or email associated to this). These credentials are NOT in any way linked to my credentials on the ABAP backend system. In the abap-deploy one is always prompted for credentials - unless provided in a config file. And this makes perfect sense. Maybe the deploy script assumes that credentials (to the ABAP backend) are provided in the CF cockpit destination to the system, but I believe this would also not make any sense, and would be a very insecure approach. I hope to hear from you soon. ,   2021-06-07 23:52:03 -  (I830561) (External Info)
Hi ,
I found that abap-deploy has been deprecated. The documentation you used was also shown as deprecated (Developing an SAP Fiori Application (Deprecated). https://help.sap.com/webcomponents/products/SAP%20Business%20Application%20Studio/584e0bcbfd4a4aff91c815cefa0bce2d/97faf19b49374c4680fbc00937fee156.html I would focus on helping you to address the issue you have with using deploy script in package.json, which was implemented by our team and is the recommended approach in the documentation: https://help.sap.com/viewer/17d50220bcd848aa854c9c182d65b699/Latest/en-US/f09752ebcf63473e9194ea29ca232e56.html You mentioned that you tried the package.json "deploy" script. This is the new recommended deploy approach implemented by our team. Since you are already logged into SBAS, your cloud user credential is used for authentication to the on-premise system available on the cloud. Therefore, no user credential prompts is required. In the screenshot "BAS_deploy_via_package_json_20210607_0934.JPG" you provided, I didn't see any error message and the deploy succeeded in the log. It indicates the deploy process successfully connected to the on premise system, successfully authenticated, and deployed "something" successfully. If you look at the screenshot, there is a line near the bottom of the logs: "App available at http://sbf970.topdanmark.local:8001/sap/bc/ui5_ui5/sap/zztest_zx7_004". Could you check if there is any content deployed to this endpoint? Best regards,

Hi. At around 14:00 (local time) I attempted to perform a deployment to a new UI5 app on the OnPremise ABAP system. I received the error again, which looks like errors we received before we disabled our terminating SSL proxy. I have attached the SCC logs right after this point in time. Although I see a lot of errors in the log - I cannot pinpoint what the root cause may be. Eventhough we got an error in BAS, the UI5 application was successfully deployed and is working in the ABAP system. Thanks,   2021-06-07 09:00:15 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi Again. I have tried deploying a new UI5 app from BAS. I get the same deployment error as before. However the ABAP BSP container is created, but is inactive and contains no content. ,   2021-06-07 07:40:57 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi . Thanks for the info. I can tell you, I have tested deployment (updates) many times since, and I am no longer seeing that error (eventhough I have not implemented the note).. How about the first error ? One more thing: When using the package.json "deploy" script, no prompt for user credentials is happening. So I am seeing a status of a successfull deployment, but actually nothing has been deployed. (I have uploaded a screen dump displaying this). Sum-up: Please answer these: 1. What can I do with the first error - regarding initial deployment of an app. 2. Is there a known limitation in the package.json "deploy" script ? Thanks,   2021-06-04 16:11:08 -  (I830561) (External Info)
Hi , The error in your 2nd screenshot is documented in the deployment guide you read: https://help.sap.com/webcomponents/products/SAP%20Business%20Application%20Studio/584e0bcbfd4a4aff91c815cefa0bce2d/340cf0109ec6451c88f7a0129990de59.html?locale=en-US The suggested fix is linked to SAP Note https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2875647. Could you check if this note can help to address your error? Best regards,

Update: Deployment is actually performed in the Update scenario. But still we get an error. ,

Dear customer,
I happy to hear that the root cause for the issue was found and that the workaround works for you.
Unfortunately the open package (https://www.npmjs.com/package/open) uses by default powershell on Windows and there is no way to provide an alternative shell.
Hope this helps!

Hello SAP, This issue has been resolved, It was because windows powershell was blocked due to our company security policy. Now security team allowed me to access power shell, and then it 's working well. I have one more question, isn't there any way  not to use powershell when previewing applicaiton ?

I can run my app with Workaround  you suggested , Thank you very much!!!! This means that my browser blocks package open, right? If so, what do i have to do? 2022-06-30 09:06:48 -  (D062812) (External Info)
Dear customer,
in the past couple of days I was researching the internet about the issue that you are experiencing. It seems that the issue is related to the system setup, but nobody can say how. What people have tried in order to resolve the issue:
Completely uninstall Node.js and delete any node_modules that are installed globally on the system. And then install Node.js again Check Firewall or Antivirus settings. Maybe the Node.js is blocked by your Antivirus/Firewall? Run VSCode/Terminal as administrator
Hereby some more information about the issue that you are facing:
When "npm run start-noflp" is executed a local server is started on "localhost:8080". Once the server is started successfully the "open" package will try to open "localhost:8080/index.html?sap-ui-xx-viewCache=false" in a new browser tab on you default system browser. In your case the last step fails. For some unknown reason the "open" package can't access your browser to open a new tab.
Workaround for your issue
1. Open a terminal in the root folder of your application (where the package.json is)
2. Execute "npx fiori run"
3. Open the URL "localhost:8080/index.html?sap-ui-xx-viewCache=false" manually in your browser.

Hope this helps!

Dear customer,
the "node_modules" are needed in order to preview the application. The deletion was only for attaching the project. Please install the "node_modules" again by executing "npm i" in the root of your project (where the package.json file is).
After installing the "node_modules" please try again to start the application.
Also I noticed that you are using Node.js v18.4.0. Could please try with Node.js v16.15.1?

Hi , Yes, you captured it perfectly correct.  I wouldn't go far and say that the message was incorrect. These are two separate steps. 1.  Connection Test to the system - this worked perfectly fine even with a private CA 2.  Retrieving catalogs - this failed while using a private CA.  Error message is not correct.  Upon updating NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS, the catalogs now show up. Thank you!  2022-08-25 08:47:46 -  (I305274) (External Info)
Hi ,

Thanks for the update. Can I please confirm the bug that you saw, and how you recreated it:

1. You tried to create a new system in VSCode.  The system you were using had a custom CA cert and our tooling could not validate that the services were being returned correctly.
2. In this case, the message you received when testing the connection was: "This SAP system connected successfully and OData V2 services were retrieved successfully. The OData V4 catalog request failed to return any services. "
3. When you updated the relevant NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS, then the services appeared correctly.

If you can confirm that was the case, then indeed the message was incorrect, and it should have stopped you from adding the system.

Please let me know if I've got the scenario correct.  We will then look to update the messaging in our tooling.

Thanks,

2022-08-25 00:29:27 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi , I think I found the root cause of the problem.  It was the private CA that our company uses and is not trusted by the NodeJS web server.  As soon as I added NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS and added our private root and intermediate in it (then restarted), the oData endpoints started appearing. I think the error message in the App Generator is quite misleading and sent me to a wild goose chase.  Would you be able to link up with the development team of the extension to double check and analyze this problem.  Potentially, a fix can be released to address the issue of the misleading error text. Thank you!  2022-08-24 20:37:38 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi , I reckon if my username and password is not correct, the "Test Connection" will fail.  But in this case, it did not fail.  Instead I got, "This SAP system connected successfully and OData V2 services were retrieved successfully. The OData V4 catalog request failed to return any services. ". If authorization is the issue, my user has SAP_ALL.  Are we expecting any other objects called that may not be part of SAP_ALL (e.g. S_RFCACL)? Thank you!  2022-08-24 20:29:50 -  (I057368) (External Info)
Hi ,
Thanks for the log output.
It indicates that the OData v2 catalog is available but your user is not authorized (a http status 401 is returned).
Please check and confirm that you have used the correct credentials - username/password combination.

Hi ,

Ok, so the catalog request is being called, but for some reason no data is being returned.  Can you please update the log level for this request by doing the following:

In VSCode, Select "Preferences > Settings" Search for "Application wizard" Change "Logging Level" to "trace" Close down your preferences as the change is automatically saved From the top menu list, select "View" and choose "Output", a new tab will open on your screen Re-run Fiori Tools wizard flow again Select your "Application Type", select "Next" Select "Connect to a System" and select your destination The same error should appear, in the output window change the output from "host-instance-log" to "Application Wizard.generators" The generated log will show the API calls being made and why the API request failed Once you have diagnosed the issue, please ensure to reset the log level back to "fatal"
Please provide any log details from this call into the issue so that we can diagnose.

Hello ,

Great to hear that your original issue has been resolved.  For your last question, when you successfully add a new saved system in VSCode, you will not see the associated services until you try and use that system in the Fiori generator.  Once you use it, the list of associated services will be displayed.

Could you please launch the Fiori generator in VSCode, choose your floorplan, and then use "Connect to a System" as  the data source option.  You should then be able to see your saved system and find the associated services for use.

I hope that helps.

Regards,

Hi , We restarted ICM and the system was added successfully in VSCode.  This means that the original problem is now solved. Nonetheless, I hope you can still share any implementation guide / configuration guide that may be reused by our basis team for upcoming systems. Lastly, I am expecting to see the oData service catalogs from VSCode after the system was successfully added in the list but somehow I do not find it.  Would you be so kind to give me a hint for this issue as well, please.

Hello , The attachments you provided seem did not go through.  Do you mind resending it.

Hi ,
Thanks for the trace, it shows that neither of the required catalog services are running.
Either v2 or v4 (or Both) of the OData catalog services as are expected to be running.
It is via connection to these services to validate the available OData catalog that the new system is able to be created from VSCode.
Verify that the following services are active in the /NSICF transaction:
sap-bc-adt sap-opu-iwfnd-catalogservice
See attached images: adt.png and catalogser.png

Hi ,

Let me answer to your last response.

I am a bit confused !!!
Sorry for that, hopefully we can resolve this now.

Should I operate according to the instructions in your reply or maybe according to the attached file you sent ?
Both are not the same and taking different approach for using VS Code offline.
Please have a look at the instructions here: https://github.com/-/sap-fiori-tools-offline-instructions/blob/main/README.md
This is the source of attached file sap-fiori-tools-offline.docx and perhaps easier to read and follow. We have already received requests for an offline setup so we decided to start a 'living' document that describes a way to use SAP Fiori tools for development on an isolated system (no internet connection). The GitHub repository is currently in my account, but is likely to be moved into one of our SAP Fiori tools repositories.

I also would like to check the option regarding the document attached if we can use jFrog instead of Verdaccio ? if yes then how ?
Assuming you are talking about artifactory from jFrog I'd say it should also work. You basically need to have a storage that can be reached from the isolated system and can be set up as npm registry to install node modules from. From my experience, artifactory can do this, however, I don't have experience with setting this up. Interesting is the part on how to get the modules from npmjs.com into artifactory, but as mentioned, I haven't done this. In Verdaccio it is pretty easy, you load it once from Verdaccio, which loads it from npmjs.com and stores it in the Verdaccio cache. We use this cache to make the offline available.

Who wrote the attached document ? is it also your group/team ?
I did and yes, I'm part of the SAP Fiori tools team.

BTW, you are right someone else from my team started to work on this on March 2022 and somehow did not finished it and now it is under my responsibility.
I am sure that with your help we will accomplish it successfully.
Yes, I remember (and found) the ticket from March 2022 when a discussion about offline usage was started with the Israel Aerospace Industries Ltd.

A short Joke:
Question: what happens when a good worker finish all his tasks/duties fast and good ?
Answer: He get more tasks (NO he does not get Salary increase)
LOL, also https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_good_deed_goes_unpunished

Hope this help!

Dear customer,
Please also check the attached sap-fiori-tools-offline.docx file. It provides detailed steps to setup dev environment that you can port to work in private network. Please let us know if you run into any problem on this issue. 2023-01-04 17:42:25 -  (I067928) (External Info)
Hello ,

Thank you for getting in touch.
I am sorry to hear you are experiencing some issues in setting up Fiori Tools offline.

Thank you for providing the details below.
When I review the list of items you have installed I can see some items are out of date, so I would recommend you get the latest versions before you proceed.

Here are my suggestions to resolve your issues:
I can see you installed node v18.12.1, however as per our documentation I would suggest you use Node 16.
I have a windows machine and I have installed node version 16.17.1
Our documentation is available here: https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_FIORI_tools/17d50220bcd848aa854c9c182d65b699/17efa217f7f34a9eba53d7b209ca4280.html

Install the latest versions of the Fiori Extension pack, as listed on this page: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SAPSE.sap-ux-fiori-tools-extension-pack version 1.8.3

Install the latest generator https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sap/generator-fiori
Currently the latest version is 1.8.4 and you can download it at: https://registry.npmjs.org/@sap/generator-fiori/-/generator-fiori-1.8.4.tgz
This module needs to be installed globally using
npm i -g generator-fiori-1.8.4.tgz
When you generate a SAPUI5 freestyle application, the resulting project will have devDependencies to following node modules:
@ui5/cli
@sap/ux-ui5-tooling

As last step, the generator will try to run npm i on the generated project. This step will fail without internet connection, but that shouldn't be an issue. Just download and copy the two modules into the root of the newly generated project (where the package.json is) and change the devDependency in file package.json
to

"devDependencies": {
"@ui5/cli": "./cli-2.14.6.tgz",
"@sap/ux-ui5-tooling": "./ux-ui5-tooling-1.5.1.tgz"
}

After you've copied the files,
you might need to change the versions, depending on what version of ui5-tooling you have and cli you have downloaded
Next, run the command
npm i

in the root of your project.

Reload VS Code cntrl_shift+p, command  --> Fiori: Open Application Generator

When you complete the above steps 1-5 & you still have issues, then please take some screen shots & send them to us & we will investigate further.
Please note, in March 2022 our team worked on another similar request from your company where someone was also setting up Fiori Tools to work offline.
And back then we also provide similar instructions as above.

Regards,
The Fiori Tools Team. 2023-01-04 15:12:51 -  (I830433) (Internal Info)

Hi Team, Uninstalling and re-installing the Fiori generator helped resolve the issue. Thank you for your support. Closing the incident. Regards,  2022-11-28 16:17:07 -  (I012956) (External Info)
Hi,

Thanks for providing those logs. I cant see anything specific there either, so there are some further things we can check and steps we can do.
First can I clarify if you have done the following:
- closed the Application Wizard ('Project from Template') window and re-opened the Wizard
- stopped the dev space and restarted it
This is to check if restarting either the wizard or dev space resolves the issue. Assuming you have done this and the issue remains, there are some things to try as for some reason the install of the generator has not completed successfully.  That could be for a number of reasons.  Can you please do the following:
1. Try and install the Fiori generator using the Application Wizard again, but this time please ensure that the "Output" tab is open and please paste the contents of the "Application Wizard" console. If this is empty, or simply states 'installing generators...' like before proceed to next step.
2. Also, can you please try and install another generator using the Application Wizard and see if that succeeds?  For example,  "generator-easy-ui5".  If that does succeed, then the problem is specific to the Fiori generator.
3. Finally, there is a chance that the Fiori generator is installed but in a corrupt state, with only some of its libraries available.  Can you please uninstall and then reinstall the generator by doing the following:
a) Open a terminal and type `npm uninstall -g @sap/generator-fiori`.  This should uninstall the existing generator,
b) Then type `npm install -g @sap/generator-fiori`.  This will install the new generator.  Please provide details of any error message received in the terminal.
Please try the above steps and let me know if you need any clarification and if they help resolve the issue.

Kind regards,

The Fiori tools team 2022-11-28 15:16:40 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)

Product Area selected: SAP S/4HANA  > Cross Components Component selected (Manual Selection): CA-BAS-WS-MNG --- Description --- See attachments Our Development team, has been trying to configure the Business Application Studio in BTP. When they are trying to access the ODATA Service – under New Project From Template selection – they are getting the following two errors.

Consume SAP Services failed. Reason: Error: Failed to get metadata. Reason: Could not retrieve the service metadata. Make sure the destination and service path are correct and that the service is available.

All catalog service requests failed for system: lsdbas. OData version(s): V2.

We followed the NOTE: https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/0003063160 to make sure our Cloud Connector and Destination under the tenant in BTP are correctly configured. Please see properties below.

We have the Property WEBIDEUsage:  odata_abap,dev_abap,ui5_execute_abap,odata_gen,odata_xs,data_abap,bsp_execute_abap,odata_gen,odata_abap,ui5_execute_abap

Hi ,
Thats good to know. I wanted to ensure that you and your colleagues are not absolutely blocked and you have a workaround for now going via Service Center route.
And yes, we will help in figuring/fixing the issue you are seeing now. Now after the change in configuration, you are bumping into separate issue. So this is plan of action:
1. Please reach out to me on *EMAIL* and we can set up a meeting. I want to check your settings and possibly run some tests on why you are seeing this authentication issue.
2. While we do that, internally I am kicking off discussion based on the information I have collected so far from you.
Regards,
 2022-04-05 16:11:31 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi  , Thanks for the workaround. During the expert session , we were told about the work around and we are using that . We are still trying to figure out the problem we are having with the direct Fiori template approach, since most developers use this path. We would like to get this fixed and not make the workaround a permanent solution. Is there anything we are missing to get the authentication error ? Is this a known issue ? Regards  2022-04-05 03:43:08 -  (I829208) (External Info)
Hi ,
Thanks for the update. At this point lets do this:
Use "Service Center":
1. Launch SAP Business Application Studio
2. Find and click "Service Center" button. If you are unfamiliar with Service Center, a quick look over here will help you locate it
https://help.sap.com/products/SAP%20Business%20Application%20Studio/9d1db9835307451daa8c930fbd9ab264/1e8ec75c9c784b51a91c7370f269ff98.html
3. Next, expand on "subaccount destinations"
4. Select your saved destination and login and select the OData service with which you want to create your application.
5. Then from right, click oon button "Service Actions" ->"Create Project from Service"
6. Select SAP Fiori generator and go ahead and follow the wizard.

Using the Service Center like described above can be used as a workaround to the issue you were seeing in generator directly.
The steps I have mentioned above are also present here https://help.sap.com/products/SAP%20Business%20Application%20Studio/9d1db9835307451daa8c930fbd9ab264/892114ce078b4e17a9ff7e751e6330cc.html
Please let me know how it goes.

Hi SAP, Any update on this ? We are still getting authentication error when prompted for Service User Name and Password, despite putting in the correct one. 2022-04-01 22:15:12 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
We followed the guided answers as suggested. We went one step forward by keeping the WebIDEUsage = odata_gen without any other options. We are now getting an authentication error, when it asks for Service User Name and Service User Password. Does this have to be a special user with special authorization. I used my own credentials which work when I try to logon to S4 Hana system but fail when I try to logon from BAS connection. 2022-04-01 04:16:11 -  (I829208) (External Info)

Solution provided: Dear Customer,
I am **** to hear you are experiencing some issues.
So I believe your issue is related to validation of HTTP requests, that are been sent
If you use HTTPS for the communication with the ABAP backend, you might have to add custom certificates to your setup. ENV NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=[your CA certificate file path]
As a workaround it is possible to disable this feature using the environment variable NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED However this method is highly insecure, and should be used with extreme care.
For more details, go to https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sap/approuter and search for NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED
I hope the above information assists you to find a solution.
Regards, The Fiori tools team

update your docker file with the following environment variable; ENV NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0 Or before your fiori command, as follows; NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0 fiori deploy --noConfig -t XXXXXXX … 2022-01-06 10:55:53 - **** (Internal Info)

Hi,
Glad it worked!
Can you elaborate on your question? When you refer to the service, are you referring to the OData service that the Fiori Elements application is consuming?
Not sure if these are the steps you are referring to?
Open your destination in your SAP BTP Cockpit; 1. Set the following Additional Property HTML5.DynamicDestination: true 2. Note the name of your destination 3. Select the Overview page of your Subaccount 4. Note the subdomain of your subaccount 5. Note the API endpoint region i.e. eu10 where the region is specified as https://api.cf.eu10.hana.ondemand.com 6. Generate the link as follows https://.launchpad.cfapps..hana.ondemand.com/dynamic_dest/ / 7. Open a new browser to validate the URL is working i.e. XML should be returned

 2021-09-20 14:38:45 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Thanks , I am now able to see the HTML application in BTP. However ,If I need to use this service externally , how to get the service endpoint for this ? 2021-09-20 13:22:48 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
Due to a recent update, the following attribute needs to be reset in your mta.yaml;

Dear developer,

--Issue description--
Customer created a Fiori Application for this in Business Application Studio and am trying to deploy this in Cloud Foundry (CF).
After deployment without error, there is no url or application found in Global Account
--Data collected--
Reproduce steps: Steps - Build and deploy  in BAS.docx

Project file: po_demo1.zip

--Research--
1. I compared customer's step with below tutorial, there is no issue with customer's steps.
https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/appstudio-fioriapps-mta-build-deploy.html
Build and Deploy Your SAP  to SAP Business Technology Platform
2. Totally no deployment error, and finished successfully.
But execute "cf help html5-list" to find application url, there is no result.
Also no application is shown in global account or DEV space.
3. Ask customer to test preview application in BAS directly, they are able to preview the application.

I tried to check internally, but didn't find any other reason why the application url is not triggered.
Could you please further guide on this?

Best regards,

2021-09-06 09:51:35 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hello , Thanks for the inputs. 1. When I preview application , it opens the app, however no output data is displayed on the application. It just shows the selection screen and output columns. When I click on "Go" , no data is displayed . Screenshot of this application preview is attached for your reference. 2. on CF Dev space , my application is not visible. 3. Please find the project zip folder for your analysis. Thanks,  2021-09-06 08:48:17 -  (I342301) (External Info)
Dear ,

When you try to expand po_demo1, and find webapp folder.
Kindly right-click on it, and choose "preview application", it is able to open the application?
Kindly go to your CF DEV space, is there any application list there?
Besides, if it didn't work, could you please upload the project zip folder to us for further test?

Best regards,

Hi ,
Based on your attached results, I can see that you are getting the following error:
"
HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
Access denied to resource / on system vaagdgw.voestalpine.root.local:8066. In case this was a valid request, ensure to expose the resource correctly in your cloud connector.

Looks like your cloud connector settings needs to be changed. Are you or your Basis colleague familiar with this OR shall I forward it to respective component?
Please let me know.

I think you forgot to add the output files. After running the curl commands, you should see the files generated as instructed in my previous communication.
Can you please attach them?

The best would be to make a remote meeting that you take a look by yourself. When do you have time?
Yeah sure thats an option, but I would like to see some basic information attached in this ticket. So if we decide to set up a meeting, I want to be sure adding relevant team members who can be of help to resolve your issue.

Hi ,
I would need some more information from you to proceed with the investigation.
502 might point out that your destination is not reachable.
But, here are some of the details you can provide to help me out. Please go through them carefully and respond to each point.
- Please open your SAP Business Application Studio and launch terminal
- Also, keep your "DESTINATION_NAME" handy as you will be using it.
1. Send me the result of the following curl command:

curl $H2O_URL/api/listDestinations > destinations.json

Above command will create a file (destinations.json) with list of all avaliable destinations.

2. Then run the following curl command and attach the respective output files. Please make sure to replace the "Destination Name"
curl -v -i.dest > destAccessHeader.txt
curl -v.dest > destAccessData.txt

Hello ,
thank you very much for the productive meeting today. Hereby a short summary of the meeting.
- We were able to solve the "Socket Closed" issue. The issue was related to the Node.js proxy configuration. After updating the Node.js proxy configuration by adding a no_proxy list, the preview was started successfully.
-  showed a second issue where a newly generated application can't be started. The issue is the same as https://answers.sap.com/questions/13732385/issue-while-executing-npm-start-run-in-vs-code-usi.html. For this issue an internal  issue was created for the "@sap/ux-ui5-tooling" team.

Hi ,
The service modeler is using the CDS compiler as well internally, however the current release it still using version 1 of the compiler, and thus do not support the newer CDS features.
The upgrade to using the version 2 of the CDS compiler is nearing release and will be available very shortly.

Fiori tools team.

Dear colleague,

Hello Tools colleagues,

can you please assist the customer in setting up his environment? To me it seems that he is still using a V1 compiler somewhere. The provided example is compilable with V2. See my explanations.

Regards,  2021-05-12 12:10:28 -  (D024701) (External Info)
Hello Mr. ,
sorry for the delay. I have taken your attached code sample and adjusted the import in the service file:

diff --git a/cat-service.cds b/cat-service.cds
index 1d99d84..64dd1c7 100644
--- a/cat-service.cds
+++ b/cat-service.cds
@@ -1,4 +1,4 @@
-using my.monitor as my from '../db/data-model';
+using my.monitor as my from './data-model';

service CatalogService {
entity Integrations as projection on my.Integrations;

From there I have been able to compile the CDS to CSN with 'cds c cat-service.cds' including the 'message' association

message          : Association to Integrations.Messages
on  message.up_.code = $self.integration_code
and message.code     = $self.message_code;

with a freshly installed (npmjs.org) @sap/cds-dk. Since you are referring to foreign keys only (especially of managed 'up_' : compiler V2 only!),
I don't see a reason why this ON condition shouldn't work.

cds -v
@sap/cds: 5.1.3
@sap/cds-compiler: 2.2.4
@sap/cds-dk: 4.1.3
@sap/cds-foss: 2.3.1
@sap/cds-runtime: 3.1.0
Node.js: v12.18.4

Unfortunately we have a glitch in the CDS CLI at the moment preventing me from running 'cds -2 edmx cat-service.cds'.
Usually I use our low level core compiler shell 'cdsc.js'. With this shell I have been able to create the EDMX posted earlier.
You can try it for yourself:
/node_modules/@sap/cds-dk/node_modules/@sap/cds-compiler/bin/cdsc.js O cat-service.cds

with `cdsc.js -h` and `cdsc.js -v` you can get a lot of help and see the core compiler version number.
From the error description you are giving me now it appears to me as something is garbled up in your project configuration or that some older CDS package (containing CDS compiler version 1) has survived in your setup.
I am forwarding your issue to our tools team for further investigation.
Regards, H.

Thanks for your reply. My environment was running the compiler version 2.  The version I had was 2.1.6 but also have updated it to the latest to be sure. cds --version return the following: @sap/cds: 5.1.1 @sap/cds-compiler: 2.2.4 @sap/cds-dk: 4.1.1 @sap/cds-foss: 2.3.1 @sap/cds-runtime: 3.1.0 Node.js: v14.16.1 The problem occurs when you are editing the cds file listed below and navigate to the Service Modeler (Fiori Tools VS Code extension). The commented code is the one I am trying to make work. The one that is uncommented is the one that doesn't give any issue. Maybe it is the way that the compilation is triggered from the extension.

Hello Mr. ,
I don't know which compiler version you are running, but due to the errors I assume you are using version 1. Please upgrade to version 2. In version 2 we added a lot of functionality to support managed compositions such as turning 'up_' into a managed association allowing to access it's foreign keys in other ON conditions (which is what you are trying to do).

Compiling your example with version 1 yields these errors:
data-model.cds:20:54-62: Error ref-undefined-def: Artifact "my.monitor.Integrations.Messages" has not been found (in entity:"my.monitor.Runs"/element:"message")
data-model.cds:21:40-43: Error ref-undefined-element: Artifact "my.monitor.Runs" has no element "message.up_" (in entity:"my.monitor.Runs"/element:"message")
data-model.cds:22:40-44: Error ref-undefined-element: Artifact "my.monitor.Runs" has no element "message.code" (in entity:"my.monitor.Runs"/element:"message")

Compiling it with version 2.2.4 (latest npmjs.org release) works flawlessly:

Hi Team, Thanks for the given solution. We followed the same steps as mentioned. There were two errors in the file which you have provided. We identified that one and corrected it. Now we are able to navigate to the target app. 1) But we are facing one more error for  zworlordercreate application. When we run index.html file, we are getting the data fine & in the backend it is showing the username as "MT_PLANNER" . When we run test/flpSandbox.html file, we are not getting the data . In the backend It is showing the username as "DEFAULT_USER". When we changed the username from "DEFAULT_USER" to "MT_PLANNER" in the backend, it is displaying the data fine. Why we are getting the username as "DEFAULT_USER" while running test/flpSandbox.html file? 2) We have made the changes as per the client requirement. When we will be deploying this app to the development system again, do we need to keep this "fioriSandboxConfig.json" file and changes which we have made in  "ui5.yaml" file as the application was working fine in development system before importing the app for code changes? or we should remove this?

,
thank you for attaching the projects. I am able to reproduce the issue. It seems that the command "Fiori: Enable App-to-App Navigation Preview" is not enabled for  projects. I will investigate to see if it is possible to enable the command also for  projects.
Meanwhile please try the following to enable the App-to-App navigation for your projects:
Download the attached "ui5.yaml" file and replace the "zworkorderlist/ui5.yaml" with it Download the attached "fioriSandboxConfig.json" file and copy it to "zworkorderlist/appconfig". Please note you will need to create the folder "appconfig" in your application! Start the "zworkorderlist" and try to navigate to the "zworkordercreate" application.
FYI: I followed this blog https://blogs.sap.com/2021/05/24/enable-app-to-app-navigation-in-bas/ in order to create the necessary app-to-app navigation configuration for your apps.
Hope this helps!

Great thanks for confirmation. At this point, to continue, I would need you projects.
If thats ok with you, can you please zip your projects and upload as an attachment here in this incident? You can use the command "Fiori: Archive Project" which will create a zip file after removing node_modules folder. Please repeat the same process for both the projects.
Any chance the above command does not work, then please zip it manually.

Thanks much.

Hi Team, We didn't do any manual changes for migration. We used migration tool for migrating projects from WebIDE. Both apps are running fine locally. But the navigation is not working. When we are trying to use Enable App-to-App Navigation Preview tool from the command palette , It shows 'Could not find any SAP Projects in Workspace' Thanks and regards,  2022-12-14 20:34:44 -  (I829208) (External Info)
Solution provided: Dear ,
Your incident has reached CA-UX-IDE (SAP Fiori tools). I will try to help you with your scenario.
But first, let me give you some background/recommendation as I want to make sure I am not making any assumption based on the info you have provided. If there is a repeat instruction, you can ignore.
1. Firstly, if you are new to BAS and/or SAP Fiori tools, then I would highly recommend that you at very least finish this developer tutorial which will give you some basic understanding of new Fiori development tooling options: https://developers.sap.com/group.fiori-tools-lrop.html
This will help you with some of the tooling options (compared to WebIDE) available in SBAS.
2. I noticed that you have used the term migration. I am not sure whether you manually changed your file or used the migration tool? If you have done manual changes, I would recommend that you do not follow that route. SAP Fiori tools comes with a migration tool which helps you in migrating projects from WebIDE to be used/compatible with SAP Fiori tools.
I recommend that you see this help link for more details: https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_FIORI_tools/17d50220bcd848aa854c9c182d65b699/70d41f3ee29d453a90efab3ce025d450.html
You also have an option to read a blog about migration here: https://blogs.sap.com/2022/01/06/migrate-sap-fiori-projects-from-sap-web-ide-to-sap-business-application-studio/
3. I also noticed that you have tried with both apps imported from ABAP repository AND original project files from your code repository. I would strongly suggest that you stick with latter which is from the original source/project files. Please see my point 2 above. Once you have the project files, use the migration tool to migrate your project.
4. Lastly. once you have done your migration via the migration tools, you would need to preview your applications. Again, please understand how its done via the option 1 tutorial. WHen you reach to this point, I am hoping you have 2 apps running locally via SAP FIori tooling options.
5. Lastly, SAP FIori tools provide App-to-App navigation preview. Please see the instructions here: https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_FIORI_tools/17d50220bcd848aa854c9c182d65b699/543675ffa6e54564a0b9e63cd400c008.html

Dear ,
Your incident has reached CA-UX-IDE (SAP Fiori tools). I will try to help you with your scenario.
But first, let me give you some background/recommendation as I want to make sure I am not making any assumption based on the info you have provided. If there is a repeat instruction, you can ignore.
1. Firstly, if you are new to BAS and/or SAP Fiori tools, then I would highly recommend that you at very least finish this developer tutorial which will give you some basic understanding of new Fiori development tooling options: https://developers.sap.com/group.fiori-tools-lrop.html
This will help you with some of the tooling options (compared to WebIDE) available in SBAS.
2. I noticed that you have used the term migration. I am not sure whether you manually changed your file or used the migration tool? If you have done manual changes, I would recommend that you do not follow that route. SAP Fiori tools comes with a migration tool which helps you in migrating projects from WebIDE to be used/compatible with SAP Fiori tools.
I recommend that you see this help link for more details: https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_FIORI_tools/17d50220bcd848aa854c9c182d65b699/70d41f3ee29d453a90efab3ce025d450.html
You also have an option to read a blog about migration here: https://blogs.sap.com/2022/01/06/migrate-sap-fiori-projects-from-sap-web-ide-to-sap-business-application-studio/
3. I also noticed that you have tried with both apps imported from ABAP repository AND original project files from your code repository. I would strongly suggest that you stick with latter which is from the original source/project files. Please see my point 2 above. Once you have the project files, use the migration tool to migrate your project.
4. Lastly. once you have done your migration via the migration tools, you would need to preview your applications. Again, please understand how its done via the option 1 tutorial. WHen you reach to this point, I am hoping you have 2 apps running locally via SAP FIori tooling options.
5. Lastly, SAP FIori tools provide App-to-App navigation preview. Please see the instructions here: https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_FIORI_tools/17d50220bcd848aa854c9c182d65b699/543675ffa6e54564a0b9e63cd400c008.html
Please follow the above guidelines/instructions and you should be able to migrate your application correct way and meet your requirements. Please feel free to open this incident if you need further assistance.

app to app navigation is working correctly on deployed apps but not working in BAS. 2022-12-14 13:05:49 -  (I330760) (External Info)
Hi,

I am now referring this to the Business application Studio dev team for further analysis.
Kind regards,

SAP Support 2022-12-14 12:34:43 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi Team, 1) First, we imported the apps from ABAP repository to WEBIDE. Then, we imported the apps in BAS From WEBIDE. We are getting this error. 2) We also tried to import the apps from our code database where we stores the original files which was used at the time of deployment. Still we are getting the same error. Thanks and regards.  2022-12-14 09:23:43 -  (I330760) (External Info)
Hi,

Can you please confirm how the apps were reimported into BAS? Was an export carried out from the development system?
Kind regards,

SAP Support 2022-12-14 09:14:54 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi Team Yes, we have imported both applications in the SAP BAS. 1) zworkorderlist3 (First app) 2) zwocreate   (Second app to which it should navigate) Thanks and regards,  2022-12-13 08:44:53 -  (I330760) (External Info)
Hi ,
Thank you for clarifying that the app is not working in BAS. I would need to look into whether app to app navigation is possible in BAS. Can you please confirm if both apps are imported into the DEV space when trying to carry out the navigation?
Kind regards,

SAP Support 2022-12-13 03:54:42 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi Team,
We ran the app index calculation report. And we have required authorization for the OData services. We are not getting 403 forbidden error.
The application is working fine in the development system(Launchpad). It is navigating from ZWORKORDERLIST3 to ZWOCREATE on clicking that particular work order.
But for the business requirement we have to do some changes in Front-end coding. For that, we imported these applications in Business application Studio from ABAP Repository. As of now we didn't make any changes in the coding part. We have just imported the apps in SAP BAS and, we are trying to run it from SAP BAS. We are getting this error only while running app from SAP BAS.
When we run index.html file, we are getting error -  "Uncaught Type-Error (Cannot read properties of undefined reading Container)."
When we run test/flpSandbox.html file , we are getting error -  " App could not be opened either due to an incorrect SAP Fiori launchpad configuration or a missing role assignment."
Can we navigate from one app to another in SAP BAS? or we can do navigations from app to app in Launchpad only.
Thanks and regards,  2022-12-09 15:17:44 -  (I330760) (External Info)
Hi ,

Thank you for contacting SAP Support. Can you please confirm if the system cache was cleared and the app index calculation report was run after the apps were deployed? Can you please also confirm if the user accessing the app has the relevant authorisatons for the Odata service as I am seeing a 403 forbidden error which could be preventing the app from navigating to the second app?
Kind regards,

SAP Support 2022-12-09 08:36:59 -  (I330760) (External Info)
Hi,

I am currently looking into this issue for you and will provide an update shortly.

Hi Team, Attached ZIP file without node_modules folder. Kind anayse the application. Regards,  2023-01-25 17:08:43 -  (I031735) (External Info)
Hello ,
Thanks for that.
Do you still see warnings after removing @sap/ux-ui5-tooling as well?
Could you attach your an archive of your project to this ticket?
Please remember to: * exclude the contents of the node_modules folder * include package-lock.json
Regards, SAP Fiori tools team 2023-01-25 10:30:47 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi Team, I have updated the results of the npm rm command. It shows same warning even after the npm rm @expo/cli. Regards,  2023-01-24 16:54:01 -  (I031735) (External Info)
Hello,

Thanks for attaching the results of running npm audit.
From the results, the vulnerable dependencies don't seem to come from @sap/ux-ui5-tooling but from @expo/cli.
You can find out for certain either by:
* removing @expo/cli (npm rm @expo/cli) and then running npm audit (those particular warnings should be gone)
OR
* removing @sap/ux-ui5-tooling (npm rm @sap/ux-ui5-tooling) and then running npm audit (the warnings should still be there).
Of course, please remember to backup your project using a source control tool (e.g git).

We don't know why @expo/cli is used in the project and unfortunately cannot help you with it.

Regards,
SAP Fiori tools team 2023-01-24 12:50:34 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
PFA the results as requested. 2023-01-23 19:00:43 -  (I031735) (External Info)
Hello!
Sorry to hear that the problem still exists.
We're unable to replicate the issue with version 1.8.5 on our side.

Can you please run the command npm audit at the terminal and attach the results to this ticket please?
After this can you please run command, npm list (For example, something like: npm list bl body-parser cl-info) for the 5 packages listed as having vulnerabilities?
Attach the results here again.

This should give us more information about the versions with the problem.

Regards,
SAP Fiori tools support 2023-01-23 16:55:31 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
We have updated as per your instruction but the vulnerability issue is still there. Please check screenshot. 2023-01-23 15:16:49 -  (D062812) (External Info)
Hello,
you can update by using one of the following:

Solution 1 - By using the SAP Fiori tools (Preferred)
1. Open the command palette of VSCode / SAP Business Application Studio
2. Search for the command "Fiori: Open Application Info" and execute it
3. If you have multiple Fiori applications in your workspace, then select the application for which the "@sap/ux-ui5-version" needs to be updated
4. Once the "Application Information Page" is loaded, click on the action to update "@sap/ux-ui5-tooling" in the "Application Status" section
Solution 2 - Manually
1. Open the "package.json" of your Fiori application
2. In the "devDependencies" make sure that the version of "@sap/ux-ui5-tooling" is just "1".
3. Delete the "package-lock.json" file from your project
4. Delete the "node_modules" from your project
5. Run "npm install" in terminal in the root folder of your project (where the package.json is)

Dear customer,
Thank you for the information. The development team is aware of this issue, for info, the "Test Connection" looks for the recommended services available at the endpoint, but doesn't fallback to the legacy version, whereas in the Fiori generator it does fallback to the legacy version.
As a workaround, can you please create a Fiori project in the Generator and for the data source step, choose:
- Connect to a System
- New System
And then enter the details of your ABAP system and as long as there is a catalog service available, it should successfully connect.
Please complete the generation of your Fiori project, and the system should be saved and available for use.
Kind regards,
 (Fiori Tools team)

Hello ,

There are a number of blogs that can help support you in creating your OData service.  Please see for example:

- https://blogs.sap.com/2021/05/06/a-step-by-step-process-to-create-odata-services-in-sap-sap-hana-system/

- https://blogs.sap.com/2016/04/13/introduction-to-creating-odata-service-in-hana-cloud-integration/

Best regards,

2022-06-13 07:40:08 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi , I'm . Thank you for helping me, I was testing the service you sended to me and it let me create the application. But, what it have to got a Web Service to work? There is a configuration guide or something? 2022-06-10 08:57:24 -  (I305274) (External Info)
Hello ,

Hope you are well.  The Fiori generator needs to be able to successfully reach the URL endpoint in order to retrieve the service metadata and use it when generating the application.

From your screenshot, it looks like you are attempting to use http://localhost:44343/path/to/odata/service as the URL for your service, and there is no service available at this location.

Can you confirm the URL of the service you would like to use?  You also need to confirm that it is accessible from BAS.  For example, if you wanted to use the sample Northwind service (https://services.odata.org/V3/Northwind/Northwind.svc/) , you can check if it accessible in BAS by opening a terminal in BAS and typing:

curl https://services.odata.org/V3/Northwind/Northwind.svc/

Please let us know if your Odata source is accessible from BAS.

Regards,

Hello customer,

SAP Fiori elements only supports OData sources that conform to the EDMX format (See https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/mc-edmx/5dff5e25-56a1-408b-9d44-bff6634c7d16).

From inspecting this service, it is returning the data in JSON format, rather than XML, and the generator cannot inspect it.

Can you please update your OData service to support the EDMX format?  In that case it should be accepted by the generator.

Regards,

Hi Colleagues,

The deployment from BAS to ABAP system fails with this message:
"Request failed with status code 409","SAPUI5 ABAP Repository with name ZUI5PROMOCRE already exists"

In a similar ticket it was mentioned that a fix is planned:
705050/2022 / BAS > DEPLOYMENT "SAPUI5 ABAP Repository with name Z*** already exists" / https://itsm.services.sap/now/workspace/agent/record/sn_customerservice_case/9bce2d381b92119c0e4a1f8f8b4bcb2b

also the internal Git repository has a request about it:
https://github.wdf.sap.corp/ux-engineering/tools-suite/issues/21868

The customer wants to know when a solution could be expected as the developers do not have access to the backend system to use a workaround.

Best regards,
 2022-10-19 07:51:55 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi , Thanks for the response. Since we don't get direct access to the client systems, workaround bit typical to use. Do we hvae some ETA for the permanent solution for this issue ? Thanks,  2022-10-18 10:05:04 -  (I044540) (External Info)
Hi ,

Thank you for the provided deploy log section.
It is a knwon issue, development is working on a fix.
The issue is that Fiori tools sends a wrong HTTP method to the backend system to update the existing content.
Until the fix is released there is a workaround is mentioned on this blog

Hi,
I have verified the version using the npm reposistory on Business Application Studio

http://nginx-redirector.repo-cache.svc.cluster.local/repository/appstudio-npm-group/@sap/node-jwt/-/node-jwt-1.6.18.tg

and using an internal cloud bot and also the npm repo using;
npm view @sap/node-jwt version
Both environments return the version. I've also checked https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sap/node-jwt?activeTab=versions which shows the version as being published.
Is it possible to re-create your package-lock.json? Can you confirm the repo in your package-lock.json that is hosting the missing dependency?
Thanks.

Hello ,
thanks for creating the ticket. After initial investigation, we would need some further information  from you to be able to reproduce the issue:
1. The version of the XML annotation LSP you use (if it is not the latest, please update to the latest and try again)
2. The version of VS code/VS code-insider you use (if it is not the latest, please update to the latest and try again)
3. The content of the output for the XML annotation language server (choose View->Output, then switch to Firoi Tools - XML Annotation Language Server). It would also be great if you could restart XML server using command sap.ux.annoataionModeler.startXmlServer and check the output data.
Looking forward to hearing from you.
Best Regards,

If you want to change the number of visible rows in the object page table, you define a presentationvariant and set there MaxItems to the desired amount of rows. Also, you reference in visualizations of the presentationvariant which lineitem annotation should be used. In the facet annotation you then refer to this presentationvariant.
Please refer further to this documentation https://ui5.sap.com/#/topic/49a6ba5b8d6946208322a9f7e16837c2

We have very high priority business issues on custom extensions Apps. All the apps were working before CE2208 release upgrade. The apps were developed and maintained by another consulting company until July 2022. versions are not managed on Git and we do not have access to source code ( TAR files). Previous consulting company suggested below approach to make amendments in existing apps.
Their suggested approach was
“1. Always Downloaded source code from Production and it will be downloaded in the form of .ZIP file. 2.In BAS we need to create a project with the same name and exact the .zip, copy the source code of controller, view, manifest, xs-app.json, Component.js, index.html. 3.Once it is done, run the app locally. If everything is fine, then build the mta.yaml file.“
First issue with the above approach is the module name, it doesn’t allow camel case, our applications are in this format. Ex: FI28_AFECashAndWCReport ,CashWCUI
We tried above approach, renamed the workspace and replaced it as required. We were getting issues in “build MTA project’. Lots of issues in files, commands etc. hence we are unable to fix the release related issues in the apps.
Can you please guide us on this? Is there any other alternatives to work on the existing apps as we don’t have TAR files. Thanks,

Dear customer,

Sorry to hear you have having issues with your Fiori project.

We have developed a migration tool to ensure that existing applications are updated to support SAP Fiori tools and can be deployed successfully using our tools.
Do you have access to the original project from source code (not just the webapp folder)?  If so, please copy that into your local workspaces.

If you do not have access to the project from source code, then when you download it from the HTML5 section in the cockpit you will only have the webapp contents so please do the following:

- Create a root directory and name it the same as your project
- add a webapp/ folder to this project directory and paste the contents of the HTML5 app into it.
- In the root directory, create a package.json file with the following contents:
{
"name": "namegoeshere"
}
After this, a migration prompt should appear.

If the migration steps does not start, go to View + Find Command + Fiori Migration and select Fiori: Migrate Project for use in Fiori Tools.

Select your project.
Leave all attributes with their default values.
Change UI5 Version if required.
Click Start Migration. A summary prompt will appear showing the migration.

Happy to jump on a call with you to support your scenario.  Can you please reach out to me at *EMAIL* and we can set up a call if the steps above don't help.

When I create a project, and I preview the application, it won’t run automatically, instead I get this in the terminal… then I have to click the local host and then it opens a browser and I have to click the index.html to launch the app, then after some time or if I press f5 in the browser the preview stops working and I have to kill the local server and start all over again.
(see console 1.png)
I’ve cloned projects from my colleagues and don’t have these problems!
Looks like the package.json files my Fiori tools is creating might be the problem.
Notice the differences between these 2 screenshots.
This is a working project
(see package.json good)
And this is one of my projects … notice the “escaping” \ around the paths ? … this is the problem!
(see package.json bad)

Hello ,
thanks a lot for our meeting today. I was able to see the issue that is happening on your side. Indeed it looks related to the \".
What we saw was that the browser URL, that should be opened, was invalid, http://localhost:8080/"test/flpSandbox.html?sap-ui-xx-viewCache=false (note the " character in the URL).
I can also reproduce the issue on my side and I am working on finding a fix. I believe that the issue is somehow related to the Node.js/npm version, but I need to investigate further to be sure.

Hi ,
would it be possible to try out the following:
1. Navigate to the "ode_modules\@ui5\cli\lib\cli\commands\serve.js"
2. On line 160 there should be the following statement "open(browserUrl, {url: true})"
3. Change it to
open(browserUrl, {url: true}).then(cp => { debugger; }).catch(err => { debugger; }); }
4. Open a "JavaScript Debug Terminal" in your VSCode
5. Navigate to your project and execute "npm start"
After the server is started, which "debugger" is hit? The one in the "then-Block" or the one in the "catch-Block"?

This could be a Window issue as it is not reproducible on Mac. 2022-03-17 21:40:48 -  (I802475) (External Info)
Hi ,
Thanks for reporting this.
To summarize what you shared in the email, you did a number of things manually to workaround the problem:
1. Removed "\" around the path on the start script. Now the launchpad starts automatically but still have to click on the tile in the launchpad to start the app.
2. After removing the parameter "sap-ui-xx-viewCache=false", the preview works correctly (the app is launched directly)
We will investigate on our end. Can you please attach the final updated package.json you modified that worked?
Thanks.

Hello Mr. , I analyzed your problem and will provide a fix with the next version of our @sap/ux-specification module, but can also tell you a workaround for the meantime: the problem was caused by an annotation definition in your file ZC_FIRE_BS_PAYMENT_HEADER_CD_VAN.xml: here you are using AnnotationPath="@UI.Identification#Administration". The qualifier of the UI.Identification annotation was not considered correctly by our software - as we did not expect any at this place. I tested if it works at all like this at run-time, but yes, the qualifier seems to be OK (we had other information so far). We will thus consider the qualifier in our module with the next version. But in the meantime, you can continue by just eliminating the qualifier from your annotation definition (only for UI.Identification, all others seem to b correct). I will keep you informed once our correction will be shipped. Best regards,   2022-10-04 09:05:17 -  (I501635) (External Info)

Hi , Thanks a lot for your response. Thanks for your efficiency. We are going to use a new server with Win server 2016 or 2019 so if we still have difficulty to use VScode or Node JS for fiori development we will create new ticket with reference to this one.

Hi ,
Fiori tools supports only Node.js versions that are LTS (Long Term Support). Currently, this is NodeJS 14.x.x. It will not work on older versions any more.
It seems "Win server 2008 R2" is very close to end of life. So worth considering upgrading the server.
I am finding it a little difficult to find exact NodeJs support for 2008 R2. It seems like NodeJS 12.x.x was supported. Node 14.x.x may work. Maybe you can try it? I don't have access to 2008 R2 server currently.
This maybe useful https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/33176

Regards,
 2022-07-20 10:35:23 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi, We install NodeJS 4.8.7 because our server run on Windows Server 2008 R2. Do you think NodeJS 14 will run to Win server 2008 R2 ? I m going to choose option 2. Best regards.  2022-07-20 09:53:32 -  (I058153) (External Info)
Hi ,
It looks like you are using NodeJS 4.8.7 from those log messages. Please ensure that you are using a new version such as NodeJS 14 https://nodejs.org/download/release/latest-v14.x/
Using NodeJS 14 should fix the error "SyntaxError: Block-scoped declarations (let, const, function, class) not yet supported outside strict mode"
For the first error you have 2 options
1. Allow binary download
 tries to download pre-built binary for the current os from https://github.com/atom/node-/releases/download. This could be added to allowed in proxy.

Alternatively
You can set in your npm config some other internal host and copy the binaries you need from github to that server
example in npm config

_binary_host = https://int.server/binaries/

2. build locally from source
Run "npm install -g windows-build-tools"  once during environment setup to setup python and c compiler to compile native modules like  .

Solution provided: Hi ,
It is not clear from the message below if you installed the Fiori generator using the command while internet access was available.
npm i @sap/generator-fiori
Alternatively using the VS Code Command "Fiori: Application Generator" also installs @sap/generator-fiori automatically assuming there is a connection to the internet.
It worth noting that when you create a new Fiori Application using the generator or check it out from source control it is necessary to perform an npm install of the project and this be default requires access to https://registry.npmjs.org/

However you can host your own npm mirror using 3rd party tools such as
https://verdaccio.org/
https://www.sonatype.com/products/nexus-repository
https://jfrog.com/artifactory/

Once one of the above or similar is configure the user creating the project should configure npm to point to that server using :
npm config set registry

Then the npm mirror needs access to the internet at minimum to populate the cache.
Create a new project and run npm install.

Note also during project generation the generator will attempt to access https://registry.npmjs.org/ and https://ui5.sap.com/ to get a list of the latest UI5 versions. If no internet access is available then fallback values will be using. But you should check of the UI5 version in the generated project best suits your target environment.
Kind regards,

Hi , Does the customer have an option to run the app generation within the DMZ, without internet access. If not, I see a problem with the given approach of the customer, as they would have to open a channel each time they want to create a new app. Then, it would rather make sense to follow the idea of  (for the dutch ministry) to place a verdaccio server outside the DMZ and just zip and copy the apps. 2022-07-13 17:23:43 -  (D022159) (External Info)
Hello , Sorry for the late reply. The normal way is that the dependencies and devDependencies as listed in package.json are loaded, and the implicitly needed open source modules are copied to the node_modules folder. Indeed, what you also could do: consolidate all npm modules as well as the one of SAP Fiori Tools on one dedicated server and install it from there. To do so, you either change path of the dependencies in package.json after the initial app generation (e.g. to  "@sap/ux-specification": "file: /ux-specification-1.102.0.tgz") or via cli common like npm i @sap/*EMAIL*2.0 --@registry=xxx. Indeed, the app generation will also ask for node modules to be installed. I do not know how this can be influenced, thus I have to pass to a colleague of mine.

Hello , We see two ways to go forward: 1. You could have one server (e.g. verdaccio) outside the firewall where you fetch all extensions and node modules (we could provide the list). Then you zip it all and bring it to a server in the intranet, and do your development in the DMZ, via WTS, as you described. The node modules, extensions, an even the VS code installation can come from this inner server, then. 2. You go the opposite way: just extract the metadata inside your firewall from your backend system (not the business data, of course). Bring it to your local machine, and continue the development locally. You can then only test with mock data, of course. Once the development is done, you zip the app (deployed to a server outside the DMZ) and bring it to the intranet for final testing against the business data. The first option has the disadvantage that you would need to continuously maintain the verdaccio, to keep on track with our release cycle: you would need to manually update the node modules list and pull the modules every two weeks to keep in sync with our latest dependencies. In the second scenario the npm modules can be pulled from your local machine, but do not need to go to the intranet. Thus it's worth thinking about this option. Please tell us which way you plan to go, and we will try to support you as good as we can, e.g. by a more detailed description.

, My network team we allow temporarly to open streams network from our server to the SAP URLs can you provide me URLs please ? Best regards.  2022-07-05 13:26:44 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
,
OK I'm waiting for your feedback regarding the URLs to be reached and other recommendations regarding the installations and the offline use of VSCode with SAP extensions.
On my side, I am asking my network team if it is possible to temporarily open the streams to the internet. If I still don't have the authorization will we be permanently blocked to use the SAP extensions or could you provide us a solution? Best regards.  2022-07-05 12:56:32 -  (D022159) (External Info)
Hello , I understand you situation now, especially when looking at the customer address. I will talk to my colleagues and give some recommendation as soon as possible. Guess we should also enhance our installation guide with regards to this aspect. A bientôt,  2022-07-05 08:46:39 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi , Concerning the installation: 1. Did you install the whole SAP Fiori Tools Extension Pack? Yes but without Internet connection we have to install all SAP extansion individually : SAP Fiori Tools - Extension Pack Included Extensions and we installed manually this following extansion :
Application Wizard SAP Fiori Tools - Application Modeler SAP Fiori Tools - Guided Development SAP Fiori Tools - Service Modeler SAP Fiori Tools - XML Annotation Language Server XML Toolkit
2. Did you also install the Application Wizard? :
Yes
The whole installation is described here. :
I followed the standard procedure to install VSCODE or Node.JS and i tried to launch npm command but without internet connection we had issue.
To connect with our on premise backend we don't have problem from our server where we installed VSCode the only thing is we didn't allow by my security team to connect our server to internet. Now if i well understood, i will have to see with my network team if is it possible to open internet network temporarly for initial load of extansions and we would accept the restrictions. Can you provide me what url is used for initial load to provide them to my network teams please? Landscape description : To create Fiori apps our developer (service provider) work from WTS without internet connection to our SAP system. A S/4 Hana migration is planned and our developer have to estimate what tools is the better solution to create Fiori apps and so we installed VSCode and Node.js with SAP extension. We also will have to install Eclipse with SAP ADT Extansion. Best regards. . 2022-07-05 08:08:58 -  (D022159) (External Info)
Hello , Concerning the installation: 1. Did you install the whole SAP Fiori Tools Extension Pack? 2. Did you also install the Application Wizard? The whole installation is described here. Your next question was if you need an internet connection. Internet or intranet? The internet connection is definitely needed for an initial load of the extensions, plus loading all the npm modules for a new app. Additionally, intranet connection is necessary for loading the (OData) resources, but after an initial load they are stored in a localService folder and you can even work offline - with restrictions:
- the app preview only works with local or mock data - you cannot update your local service information (Service Manager) - deployment needs a connection to your target server. Just to name a few. If you would like, you can describe you landscape and the planned projects in more details so that we can further validate the options. Best regards,
 Fiori Tools Dev. Support

I have removed the npm version . The present version 8.11.0. Restarted the SAP BAS. But Service modeler is missing . 2022-12-15 14:04:21 -  (C5226337) (External Info)
Solution provided: Dear Customer,

SAP BAS currently only supports npm version 8. In npm version 9 breaking changes were introduced to its API which causes extension installation failure. SAP BAS provides npm version 8 by default.

To fix the issue please do the following: 1. Remove currently installed npm version by running a command "npm remove -g npm"
2. Restart the dev space

Hi Colleagues,
Here the customer is frustrated at the differences in BAS from WebIDE.
They found that there are a lot of little things that webide could do easily but now BAS cannot do, for example adding the "clear" button in a project; see attached document for details.
I could not find much documentation here, and certainly not a BAS versus Webide one.
Does the customer have to move to BAS fully? Or is WebIDE still good to stay with?
Are there plans to improve BAS further?
Thank you and my kind regards,

Dear customer
The component you have selected is for the S/4 rapid activation scripts and not Fiori Applications. In the future, to prevent unnecessary delays, any app related requests should be directed to the component relevant to the app in question. To find the correct component, see Fiori Apps Library ( https://fioriappslibrary.hana.ondemand.com/sap/fix/externalViewer/ )>Search for App>Implementation Information>Support>Application Component.
Since your query is about BAS, I will get you over to the BAS team to address this incident.
Thanks

The deployment fails and we get a 502 error in the BAS. In the Cloud Connector we could see the error message "TooLongFrameException: HTTP header is larger than 8192 bytes". We found note 2875647 "SAPUI5 ABAP Repository Load via OData: URL parameters to reduce size of messages in HTTP response header" that sounded promissing. Our FES system is newer than mentioned in the note so the correction is already included, nothing to do on this side. We are starting the deployment from the BAS, but it looks like the two mentioned parameters are not handed over to the backend system. Then we tried the second option mentioned in the note and increased the parameter httpProtocolProcessorMaxResponseHeaderSize in the Cloud connector from 8 to 64 (which is the maximum we can configure). Now there is no error in the cloud connector anymore and we do not get the 502 error in the BAS anmore, but now we get these errors:
info builder:custom deploy-to-abap Starting Deployment. ERR! builder:custom deploy-to-abap Parse Error: Header overflow ERR! builder:custom deploy-to-abap Deployment Failed. ERR! builder:custom deploy-to-abap Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'data') Attached you can find the complete deployment log to see how the deployment is done. How can we make sure that the response header does not get too large? It looks like the two mentioned parameters are not handed over to the backend system even though we start the deployment from the BAS as mentioned in the note. Best regards,

Dear customer,
The error message in your attached deploy error log also indicate the large header data size. The error message "Parse Error: Header overflow" is in the http response from the backend. We are currently working on enhancing the debug log for http messages involved in deploy, and the new version should be included in the next release. I will send you instructions to install newer version and enable the debug log. For now, I found one issue from your attached log. If you look at the long list of archive files following this line "info builder:custom deploy-to-abap Create Archive" in the log. You can see many unnecessary files within .git folder are included in the archive. This could result to a large number of unnecessary files included in the zip file for deploy, which might be related to the root cause of the header overflow error. Can you check if you have a .git folder at /webapp/.git? Usually the .git folder should be under the project root. You should remove the .git inside the webapp folder. 2023-01-16 10:25:42 -  (I508774) (Internal Info)

Hello , Could you please let us know, do we need to update this "minUI5Version" again in future or it would be auto updated ? If we need to update it again manually, what is the time period that we have to update it ? This is to make sure we do not get stuck like this again in future. Regards,  2022-08-17 13:48:32 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hello , Just some time back I created a new project and cross checked the "minUI5Version" from manifest.json, changed accordingly in my project and it worked correctly. Also, now as you mentioned to change the same thing, I am confirmed that this was the root cause. Now the issue is resolved and this INC can be closed. Regards,  2022-08-17 12:52:31 -  (D062812) (External Info)
Hello ,
I can see in the project that you attached that in the manifest.json you have "minUI5Version: 1.84.7". It seems that this version was removed from the SAPUI5 SDK. From the versions list on the SAPUI5 SDK, the next possible versions would be: 1.84.8, 1.84.9, 1.84.10, 1.84.11, 1.84.12, 1.84.13, 1.84.14, 1.84.15, 1.84.16, 1.84.17, 1.84.18, 1.84.19, 1.84.20, 1.84.21, 1.84.22, 1.84.23, 1.84.24, 1.84.25, 1.84.26, 1.84.27, 1.84.28.
Could you please try changing the version in the manifest.json to one of the versions above? Afterwards please try to start the application again.
Hope this helps!

Hello , Also the other entry was removed by them and still the issue. 2022-08-16 12:44:05 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hello , I checked with Basis team, the destination is working fine and the overlapping entry which you mentioned was created by the Basis team after the issue was found just to check. The issue has detected before that, so it should not be the cause of the issue. Attached is the screenshots in doc "SAP INC Aug (2)". Regards,  2022-08-16 12:23:42 -  (I044540) (External Info)
Hi ,

The /sap path is mapped to this on-premise resource
backend: - path: /sap url: http://vhpthds4ci.sap.partstown.com:44300/ client: '110' destination: DS4_DEV

The cloud connector logs shows this entry about overlapping ports:
2022-08-16 08:36:08,749 +0000#INFO#com.sap.scc#https--nio2-8443-exec-3#          #Overlapping port ranges or identical ports for virtual hosts vhpthds4ci.sap.partstown.com:44300 and vhpthds4ci.sap.partstown.com:44300 com.sap.scc.servlets.RequestFailureExecution$InvalidRequest: Overlapping port ranges or identical ports for virtual hosts vhpthds4ci.sap.partstown.com:44300 and vhpthds4ci.sap.partstown.com:44300 at com.sap.scc.ui.SubaccountControl.addSystemMappings(SubaccountControl.java:436) at com.sap.scc.servlets.AccessControlServlet.addSysMapping(AccessControlServlet.java:140)

In the cloud connector could you select the BAS subaccount, in access control list ensure that virtual host (http://vhpthds4ci.sap.partstown.com:44300/ ) exists only one time, remove the other entry, then test it again.

Could you capture some traces about the case:
1. Capture an HTTP trace from the browser, see SAP KBA
1990706 How to capture an HTTP trace using Google Chrome or MS Edge (Chromium)

2. When the application reaches on-premise resource via cloud connector, increase trace level in cloud connector under log and trace files section:
- set Cloud Connector Loggers to ALL
- set Other Loggers to Information
- set Payload Trace flag on, ensure that BAS subaccount is selected

3. Replicate the issue and send us the logs
- .HAR file, HTTP trace
- ljs_trace.log from cloud connector
- traffic_trace_ _.trc from cloud connector

Hi,
Thank you for providing detailed information for this issue. There are some additional steps you can perform to help with connection issues on SBAS and will provide output that can be attached here.
Please follow these steps, taken from Guided answers https://ga.support.sap.com/dtp/viewer/index.html#/tree/3046/actions/45995):
Another option is to use SAP Fiori Tools Environment Check;
1. From SAP Business Application Studio, open command palette via View -> Find Command and enter "Fiori: Open Environment Check" -> Enter credentials if prompted -> Choose a location to save
2. A generated "Preview results.md" file is opened. Please check the section "Destination Details". SAP Fiori tools Environment Check will find and suggest if any destination parameters are missing.
3. Now, Log on to the SAP BTP cockpit as an administrator. From your global account, navigate to your Cloud Foundry environment subaccount.
4. In the navigation area, choose Connectivity -> Destinations.
5. Select your destination, and verify that in the "Additional Properties" of your selected destination, you have at least the recommended properties based on the SAP Fiori tools Environment Check.
Please check if these steps help resolve or find the cause of the issue. If not please attach the "envcheck.zip" and we can analyse this and provide further assistance.

Hi,
Thanks for the update on this. The KBA you mentioned ##2452568 is for collecting logs and trace files for the cloud connector. From your response I believe you are referring to KBA ##3063160 which describes the browser calls for the services. From this KBA once a valid XML is returned for any of the services listed it is okay. However you shown that /sap/opu/odata4/iwfnd/config/default/iwfnd/catalog/0002/ returns an error. You also showed in DestinationURL.PNG that /sap/opu/odata/IWFND/CATALOGSERVICE;v=2/ServiceCollection?%24top=1 also returns an error. However it seems you were calling this using the virtual host and not internal so this may be working now?
Can you please clarify with screenshots what calls here are working and which are not?
I can also see that in your screenshot of the destination your URL is http but in the cloud connector screenshot in the document services.docx the protocol is HTTPS. Can you please check and clarify this?
Please update us on the above

good day, According to the SAP note 242568 we should test if the urls can be accessed. The following url cannot be accessed as the iwfnd/config is not published. Is this a requirement for odata services to be used? All other urls in the note do work, except the following one: https://sapfidev.sanlam.co.za/sap/opu/odata4/iwfnd/config/default/iwfnd/catalog/0002/ 2022-03-14 16:09:01 -  (I531230) (External Info)

The CA-FLP components are only intended for the Fiori Launchpad itself. In the future, to prevent unnecessary delays, any issue with Business Application Studio should be reported to the correct component under CA-BAS area.

Thank you,  SAP Support



******************************



We work with an installation of Visual Studio Code on premise. Unfortunately generating apps with the Fiori Tools installed in VSC does not. There seem to be issues communicating through our proxy. We set the proxy as environment variable in Windows OS: http_proxy, https_proxy and no_proxy for our SAP systems. Additionally we configured the proxy in npm config (.npmrc file): http-proxy, https-proxy and strict-ssl With these settings we were able to install nodejs, the required npm-packages e.g. mta and yeoman. Also via command line we can execute npm install -g @sap/generator-fiori The VSC extensions for Fiori Tools could also be installed and VSC has internet connection e.g., to check for updates. However, once we try to generate a app via the Application generator we experience error messages for both of this use cases: 1. Open the Application Generator (Template Wizard) and click on “Explore an Install Generators” on the upper right corner, error message: { "error": { "code": "ERR_HTTP_HEADERS_SENT", "errno": "ERR_HTTP_HEADERS_SENT", "type": "system" }, "label": "Application Wizard.Webview Rpc.RpcExtension.RpcCommon", "level": "error", "message": "handleRequest: Failed processing request rpc-request id: 0.35467059063423356", "time": "2022-07-12T10:00:15.779Z"} 2.

Hi , we had version 1.6.6 installed. I have now uninstalled version 1.6.6 and installed version 1.7. Now everything works as we expect. I have also already tested this with a colleague. Thank you very much for the great support. 2022-08-16 11:43:40 -  (I012956) (External Info)
Hi ,

Can please you check the what version of the Fiori generator you have installed by either of the following:
- In VSC, on the floorplan selection step hover on the '?' beside the text 'Which floorplan do you want to use?' A tooltip with the version will show, I've added a screenshot as example.
- On the command line you can run:
npm list -g --depth=0 | grep "@sap/generator-fiori"

The latest version of the generator is 1.7.0 and should have a fix for the failing ui5 version retrieval. The generator version should be kept up to date by the extensions, but if you have an older version you can update it manually by running from the command line:
1. npm uninstall -g @sap/generator-fiori
2. npm install -g @sap/generator-fiori

Can you check this, and in case you had an older version please retest the flow and let me know if it gets passed the error.

Kind regards,

 , I have created a document in which I have stored both errors with screenshots and error messages.
Our main Problem is the second Crash which occurs after the rename of the Viewname. 2022-08-04 09:54:15 -  (I012956) (External Info)
Hi ,

Thanks for checking that.
Can you please try to set 'no_proxy' env var to the hostname of the sap system you are trying to connect to, e.g.
no_proxy=s07sap.11.am-gruppe.de:14402
and retest from VSC and from '' on the cli?

Also, can I ask you to confirm exactly where the crash is happening in the generator? (is possible please provide screenshots of the point where the crash is happening).
From the initial description it happened after the data source selection step when viewname was entered and pressing next, but in other cases its now happening at the data source step. I ask as there will be a bug fix as part of the release of Fiori generator planned for this week for retrieval of UI5 versions in environments where no external network access is available, which would provide a workaround if this issue is due to UI5 version retrieval.
Kind regards,

Hi ,
Are you able to test any OData service URLs directly via a web browser on the machine? This would help to identify if external access to the odata services is possible outside of Fiori tools. You could also test an odata url by using the generator in VSCode and selecting 'connect to an odata service' and entering the url there.
In general we dont have any specific proxy settings required for our Fiori tools, once your local machine proxy is configured as required by your company for access to the sap systems it should be fine.
I will reach out to colleagues on my team to help investigate further on what might be causing the issues here or if there is any specific config missing for this proxy to work. Please also let me know if you can access odata services directly via URL for the sap system.
Kind regards,

Hi ,
Ok your recent logs show that there is a more general issue as from the command line the call to the sap system is throwing an error, which could be due to the proxy. This is different to the last error I mentioned (requesting UI5 versions) and shows the errors are happening outside VSCode so are not directly caused by it.
Reviewing the steps you've taking for setting up, can I ask you to try maintain each environmental var proxy config in both lower and upper case and retry? e.g http_proxy and HTTP_PROXY. Also, what value are you setting for strict-ssl in npm config? Can you try setting this to false?
Kind regards,

Hi ,
Thanks for additional logs and debugging. The new log you provided related to retrieval of UI5 version choices for the final step in the wizard, which is not something we see normally. I'd like you to try run the generator from the command line to check if the proxy errors are related to VSC or something else.
Based on your comments, you mention you have Yeoman installed already. If not you can install it by running:
'npm install -g '
Once Yeoman is available, from the command line/command prompt (and in a directory you want to create an app into) run this command to start the Fiori generator:
' @sap/fiori'
The prompts here will be same flow to generate an app as in VSC. Can you step through these and let me know if you can successfully generate an app by this method or still get an error? This will indicate if the proxy issue is in VSC or more general.
Kind regards,

Hi ,
the proxy settings are set correctly and are also used correctly by the VSC. the VSC uses the environment variables of the operating system and when we try to 'Connect to a System' it crashes the generator.
I have analyzed our problem again with a proxy colleague and we find something:
With the last access, a wrong access is established by the VSC. The tool tries to access an external source directly with a GET command:
GET https://ui5.sap.com/neo-app.json HTTP/1.1 Accept: application/json, text/plain, */* X-Csrf-Token: Fetch User-Agent: axios/0.26.0 host: ui5.sap.com Proxy-Authorization: Basic djA2NTg4MmM6cVBaOVZjRmhZY1ZzUVlOYzNkVXI= Connection: close
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request Cache-Control: no-cache Pragma: no-cache X-XSS-Protection: 1 Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8 Proxy-Connection: close Connection: close Content-Length: 1099
However, since the tool is behind a proxy, a CONNECT must first occur for a successful GET command:
Example:
CONNECT webanalytics2.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com:443 HTTP/1.1 Proxy-Authorization: Basic djA2NTg4MmM6cVBaOVZjRmhZY1ZzUVlOYzNkVXI= Host: webanalytics2.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com Connection: close
HTTP/1.1 200 Connection established
Any idea how we can get the tool to first build a CONNECT and then execute the GET command 2022-07-20 12:41:52 -  (I012956) (External Info)
Hi ,

I'm  from the Fiori tools team, working with the App Generator. I've reviewed the logs you have provided and have some things to check:

- in VS Code can you go to: 'preferences' > 'settings' and search for 'proxy'. This is where proxy config is set for VS Code. Please review and the maintain the settings here as required for your environment. If you are unsure or still get errors, please provide a screenshot of the proxy config from VSCode.
- during the app generation where you see errors, can you confirm the exact data source type you select? Is it 'Connect to a System' or 'Connect to an OData Service' (or some other). And the error you see, does it crash the generator? Or only show up in the output logs?

King regards,

We work with an installation of Visual Studio Code on premise. Unfortunately generating apps with the Fiori Tools installed in VSC does not. There seem to be issues communicating through our proxy. We set the proxy as environment variable in Windows OS: http_proxy, https_proxy and no_proxy for our SAP systems. Additionally we configured the proxy in npm config (.npmrc file): http-proxy, https-proxy and strict-ssl With these settings we were able to install nodejs, the required npm-packages e.g. mta and yeoman. Also via command line we can execute npm install -g @sap/generator-fiori The VSC extensions for Fiori Tools could also be installed and VSC has internet connection e.g., to check for updates. However, once we try to generate a app via the Application generator we experience error messages for both of this use cases: 1. Open the Application Generator (Template Wizard) and click on “Explore an Install Generators” on the upper right corner, error message: { "error": { "code": "ERR_HTTP_HEADERS_SENT", "errno": "ERR_HTTP_HEADERS_SENT", "type": "system" }, "label": "Application Wizard.Webview Rpc.RpcExtension.RpcCommon", "level": "error", "message": "handleRequest: Failed processing request rpc-request id: 0.35467059063423356", "time": "2022-07-12T10:00:15.779Z"} 2.

Dear customer,
It appears that our last reply didn't reach you. Can you please take a look at the response from June 11th and let us know if this answers your question 2021-06-11 10:38:35 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,

There are two ways to generate an Fiori Elements app using a destination that is configured as a full service URL.
1. Using SBAS, you can now use the Service Centre tab, located on the navigation bar on the left, to create a Fiori Elements app using such a destination. This will bypass the odata source screens and allow you to progress to the creation phase. This flow will also allow you to locally preview the application and also to deploy to CF.
2. Currently, our Fiori Element app is being tested to support the same flow as outlined in step 1 but using the Data Source screen. This should be ready for the next release due in 2-3 weeks.
Please note, we had a new release this week so please ensure you are running the latest version `npm i -g @sap/generator-fiori`
Any other issues, please let me know.

Hi , I am assigning this incident to you as I am out for vacation next week and next week is when we are releasing https://github.wdf.sap.corp/ux-engineering/tools-suite/issues/9131
Thanks,
 2021-05-07 08:11:06 -  (I829208) (External Info)
Hi ,
Thats great. At this point, can you please create another message in our component "CA-UX-IDE" for the issue in deployment scenario. This will allow us to track the progress on issue resolution separately.
Now, I will keep this ticket open with me to provide the solution of the original reported issue of App Generator not working with destination pointing to service URLs. I will let you know when its released.
Also, based on our conversation, I am lowering the priority of this ticket as I am hoping the solution provided to you, got you past the application generation blocker.

Thanks,

Hello , thank you for the support. I've confirmed that Fiori application is working and displaying data. But when accessing the deployed Fiori application, the application itself is up and running but the OData from CAP is not displayed and this time even the metadata fetch returns 404. Best Regards 2021-05-06 05:41:29 -  (I829208) (External Info)
Hi ,
Thanks for your project which helped me in the investigation. I spent time over your CAP project we well as generated one.
In the end, I had to make changes in the following places:
1. webapp/view/View1.view.xml
2. manifest.json
I have provided snapshot of the change (compared to the one present in your repository). I have also provided the project with changed files. I was able to view the backend data in the app.

Next Steps:
1. Please confirm whether you are able to use the project (with the changes) and you are able to verify that your app is functioning.
2. Your second issue was with deployment. Can you please re-deploy after making above changes and see whether you are able to get past the last reported issue?

Once I have your confirmation, I will tell you the next steps.

Best Regards,
 2021-05-05 14:45:21 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi , For the generated project source, please go through the below link. https://github.com/micol92/fioriui5generror.git From the point of customer perspective, we can't understand why the customer do the quality assurance task. For the BAS upgrade, SAP should have done a quality assurance task before releasing the new version. And SAP provide rights to choose old version to the customer. BTW, I don't understand why customer have to do verification work on the new version. Best Regards 2021-05-05 14:02:06 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi , I make sure that you make Fiori project with below OData catalog lists because there is no special scenario. You can confirm that any Fiori templates have same problem.

HI ,

Thanks for trying it out. Can i ask you for your generated project please? (you can delete the node_modules folder -> zip -> attach it here)

Hello , Sorry to hear that Fiori generator currently does not provide the ability to use the destination with a direct service URL. I've tested "Connect to an OData Service" and summarized results as attached file("BTP_Issues summary.pptx"). Summarized results are as followings. Issue#1
Locally run the Fiori application via “Run Configurations” menu. The application is up and running locally but data from CAP OData is not displayed. The metadata is fetched as shown in the network tab but the console mention “[ODataMetadata] initial loading of metadata failed” and “Invaild metadata document”. Issue#2 When accessing the deployed Fiori application, the application itself is up and running but the OData from CAP is not displayed and this time even the metadata fetch returns 404.

Dear Customer,
I will be helping you out with your issue from SAP Fiori tools side (of which Fiori Generator is part of).
For more info about SAP Fiori tools, you can check out help portal page: https://help.sap.com/viewer/product/SAP_FIORI_tools/Latest/en-US

Coming to your generator issue at hand, Fiori generator currently does not provide the ability to use the destination with a direct service URL. While we are working to provide this capability, in the meantime, you should be able to use this service directly with the Fiori elements generator, without having to create a destination.  Can you please do the following:
1. Launch the Fiori elements generator in SAP Business Application Studio
2. On the 'Select your Data Source' section, please choose 'Connect to an OData Service'
3. Provide the URL to your data source in the box provided.
4. Enter your credentials and continue.

Can you please validate if that works out for you?

Best Regards,
 2021-05-03 14:24:39 -  (I044540) (External Info)
Dear Customer,

The previous template was deprecated which worked with the CAP application.
As workaround use a local project,  I'm checking with development if the previous template can be retrieved or not.

Dear Customer,

Could you attach the CAP project which offers the Odata service:
https://scp-kr-lottechembtppoc-core-lccap01-srv.cfapps.ap11.hana.ondemand.com/vtcat/Realtmrt01

We need to test it internally, from BAS template the https://services.odata.org can be used without any issues.

From BAS terminal could you test the availability of the services.odata.org availability:
curl https://services.odata.org/V4/OData/OData.svc/

and check the same for the used HTTP destination, at the end of the URL insert the Odata service path:
curl --insecure -v https://scp-kr-lottechembtppoc-core-lccap01-srv.cfapps.app11.hana.ondemand.com

Please let me know the output.

Product Area selected: SAP Business Application Studio Product Function selected: SAP Business Application Studio  > SAP Business Application Studio Component selected (Product Function Selection): CA-BAS-RUN-HTML5 --- Steps to Reproduce --- NOTE TO SAP SUPPORT: I give my approval for SAP Support to reproduce the issue described, while connected to my impacted non-production environments, using any steps provided in the description below or provided later, even if the steps result in a change being made, until the issue is closed. --- Description --- We moved some app from NEO enviroment to CF one. We deployed them on CF using BAS and configured the Launchpad Service, everything is ok and all the app run correctly consuming the destinations that are set on BTP. Than we tried to configure the apps to locally run from business application studio for debugging purpose. First we created the run configuration binding also all the necessary detinations, than we adjust the launch.json configuration with the correct workspacefolder path. Now when we run the configuration created before the app starts but than a 503 error occur on all the destinations that it must consume. As i said the destinations are binded correctly in the local configuration. All this configurations are made only on the pchomepage app and in the pcestrattoconto app. I attach some screenshots that may be helpfull. Thank yuo for the help.

Customer is no longer blocked and thus it would be confusing at this stage to provide another option on how to migrate their project using Fiori Tools.

Hello , It looks like you could solve all your issues on your own, so no other things to do from our side, I hope. If you still find something please let us know. I had a short sync with  who had a call with you, he gave me the information that you did the migration on your own, without using the SAP Fiori Tools that are developed by my group. So maybe it is a good idea if I share some links with you about th migration capabilities that we have, it might be useful for migrating further apps, or for validating the existing one: What is Fiori tools?

Hi,
Based on the documents attached it seems your technical user does not have access to the catalog service for the S4Hana backend system. This is normally the case where either the v2 or the v4 catalog of services are restricted.
In this case, please refer to the following guided answer to resolve your issue;
https://ga.support.sap.com/dtp/viewer/index.html#/tree/3046/actions/45995:48363:52803
The recommendation is to use a partial URL destination since this will allow you to create multiple apps using the same destination.
Please let me know if this resolves your issue.

Dear customer,
from the screenshot of the destination attached to the incident I can see that destination was created with authentication BasicAuthentication. Such destination type is not supported for integration of BAS and S/4HANA Cloud.
Please follow the steps outlined in the tutorial https://developers.sap.com/group.abap-custom-ui-s4hana-cloud.html, in particular follow the steps to create a destination of type SAMLAssertion.
Documentation of configuration steps can also be found in Integrating SAP Business Application Studio.

Please assist here. The customer is trying to configure BAS to S/4HANA Cloud connectivity. Based on the internal wiki this is SAP_COM_0613 but nothing in the external documentation mentions this scenario. So maybe it's not needed? I don't know. Hoping you can help the customer get it setup.

Hi Support, The Comunication escenario doesn´t exist to configure. 2022-06-21 16:49:37 -  (I826631) (External Info)
Dear Customer,
Your case reached the BC-SRV-APS-EXT-WDE team. This is the area that supports SAP_COM_0013, which is a deprecated communication scenario for connecting the old Web IDE with S/4HANA Cloud. Based on the details so far, it seems you're trying to connect Business Application Studio to S/4HANA Cloud. I reviewed your document and you're using SAP_COM_0053. This is not for BAS integration. Please follow the documentation linked above and use SAP_COM_0613 for BAS integration.
If you need further assistance with this I can route this to BC-SRV-APS-EXT-BAS.

Hi support, We have tested the note 3063160 already but it talks about on-premise system and we are working with S4HC. As we are working on S4HC, we don't use Cloud Connector. I think that may be a authorization problem on the S4HC side because when we execute the APP in BTP, and It tries to connect from BTP to S4HC, the error is generated in the S4HC APP "Message Monitoring OData Error LOG". This is the error:
No authorization to access Service '/IWFND/SG_MED_CATALOG_0002' If we connect directly to the S4HC API and set the user RFC_USER, then it works fine. The problem is when we connect through the Destination. If we try to execute the APP vía Portal, we also get "403 Access Denied": https://-test-hew42olm.cpp.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/site?siteId=d323d942-287f-4284-80cf-1d6375a62288#Shell-home Regards. 2022-06-21 02:16:50 -  (I058980) (External Info)

If you change for the URL of the S4HC SYSTEM. In our case :
https://my400353.s4hana.cloud.sap/sap/opu/odata/IWFND/CATALOGSERVICE;v=2/
Then it works fine, but the problem we have is when we try to conect from BTP to S4HC, where our URL is the following (URL of the app deployed to BTP) https://-test-hew42olm.cpp.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/19199232-ec8a-4600-8bbb-c6855f019371.com--m-carga_pedidos_compra.comsothismcarga_pedidos_compra-1.0.0/index.html

/sap/opu/odata/IWFND/CATALOGSERVICE;v=2/
To https://-test-hew42olm.cpp.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/

The call returns "Not Found"
If we check the S4HC Log, we can see that there is an authentication Error with this description:

Hi Support, Via oData we have verified that it works, but that has always worked before opening the incident, with NEO we used the destination so as not to have to change the Odata URL for each environment we want to connect to, but with cloud foundry doesn´t work by connecting to systems via destination.
We have seen in the SAP documentation, with what I understand that it should be possible to connect through systems, since connected by odata works but it is not what we are looking for. If you need to check the comunication arragements please check the document attachment or if you need a meeting please tell us. Best Regards, . 2022-06-13 02:12:02 -  (I058980) (External Info)
Dear customer,
You can use oData service from S4HC from BAS for sure, but not via catalog way, but pointing to the specific odata service you want to consuem directly.
You should ensure that you could access the targetting odata endpoint using basic authentication successfully. If you are not able to do that you may consult with S4HC team to check the communication arrangement.

When we select the destination in BAS (with the communication user) the following entry is created in S/4Hana Cloud /IWFND/CX_ACCESS_CHECK : No authorization toa ccess Service '/IWFND/SG_MED_CATALOG_0002' The problem is that is a communication user and we cannot add roles to it Regards 2022-06-10 12:57:19 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)

Dear customer,
In case you are using S4HANA system as the backend, you should not use the option Connect to a System, because the catalog service is not available. Instead you should connect to the targetting oData service directly.
For more details please check the NOTE below: 3063160 - All catalog service requests failed for system: /. OData version(s): V2, V4. -------------- If your backend system is S4HANA, please use a odata service URL instead of the catalog --------------

Hi ,
Thanks for the attachments. I have reviewed the cloud connector logs and in these logs I see the following error:
The account c726e1ca-6126-42e8-9ac5-8c9bd1b7b187 is not trusted for JWT principal propagation!
Do you have principle propagation somewhere in this scenario? If yes it seems this issue is caused due to a mix of authentication types as you have basic in the destination.
Please update me with details of your principle propagation configuration

Hi , That worked. We had set up alias of backend system. After changing it to LOCAL in Front end server, we were able to deploy to correct system. Thank you so much for you help. That was clear and concise answer for me. Thank you. 2022-11-22 22:05:27 -  (I829208) (External Info)
Hi ,
My name is  with SAP Fiori tools development team and I will try to help you resolve your issue.
Based on conversation in this ticket till now, looks like you are having Hub deployment in your landscape. Please note at this point I am assuming that you or your BASIS colleague knows how to register service from backend system in FES via transaction SEGW.
To give you a bit more background, SAP Fiori tools deploys SAP Fiori applications using the OData service "/UI5/ABAP_REPOSITORY_SRV" (/sap/opu/odata/UI5/ABAP_REPOSITORY_SRV ).
So there is a possibility that you have this service registered alias to backend, BUT this particular service needs to be registered in your Front-End Server with LOCAL alias. Local System alias will be required to refer objects of same system. Can you please create such an entry or if it already exists then delete the service registration and register again with LOCAL alias. By doing this, when you deploy next time, it should deploy to you FES.
Hope that gives you some direction to work on. Please let me know how it went. If you need more step-by-step dedicated instruction, we can work something out.
Thanks,

Could you please kindly attach a step-by-step document with screenshots demonstrating the issue including how you create FreeStyle application?
Please share entire output for below commands in txt file: npm run deploy-config npm run deploy

Hi ,
The issue is that for local running/ preview of the Fiori Elements application the officially published UI5 versions are used from a UI5 CDN site. For security reasons old versions of UI5 are deprecated and removed and are no longer available on the CDN. This means that when previewing, a Maintained version of UI5 that may be higher than the version on the source system is required. For the source system the UI5 artifacts are from the source system itself so the same issue is not experienced. For further information you could read the following blog https://blogs.sap.com/2022/04/14/sapui5-patch-level-independent-bootstrap/ and specifically the following reply comment https://blogs.sap.com/2022/04/14/sapui5-patch-level-independent-bootstrap/comment-page-1/#comment-635645 which leads to the following useful information:

For your specific case please see point 6. in the file 'Create Project from template in BASP BAS' and update the 'Minimum SAPUI5 version' to 1.71.38 at least which will be valid until the end of this the 3rd quarter, however you may benefit from extending to a further maintained version such as 1.71.42 which will be maintained until Q4 2022, using the Source system version is out of date in this case.

Sorry for the slow reply.
For the error 403 when trying to deploy, you need to add an .env file with the username/password to connect and then redeploy. These steps are documented https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sap/ux-ui5-tooling See => "Command to create the ui5-deploy.yaml file"

Hello , Yes as already mentioned, we have three FIORI application which is currently running in UI version 1.38.6. Currently, we have a Business Application Studio for the development but in that, we are failing to run those applications locally. So below are the options I need to do from BAS : 1. To run locally the already built FIORI applications(it's extended ones) 2. To deploy the already built applications to ECC. 3. To create a brand new application using 1.38 and deploy the same to ECC.

Hello , As per your suggestion, I tried migrating the app to which got the error saying"Project type not supported for migration". I have attached the error doc with the steps.

Hello ,
SAP Fiori tools (of which Fiori generator is part of : https://help.sap.com/viewer/product/SAP_FIORI_tools/Latest/en-US) currently supports minimum of 1.65 UI5 version.
Having said that, can you comment what all capabilities are you looking while sticking to using 1.38? For example, you might want to test your existing application locally in your dev space, deploy your existing application, or you want to create a brand new application using 1.38, etc.

Best Regards,
 2021-04-30 10:00:14 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hello , Thank you for providing the steps. I will definitely follow this and try to run the application. In case of any issue, will get back to you again. I have one more query, whenever I am trying to build an app using a template I am only able to see the UI5 version starting from 1.65. Is there any way where I can create an app using 1.38 and then run it? Please let me know. have already attached the screenshot for it. Regards  2021-04-30 05:47:19 -  (I829208) (External Info)
Hi ,

Thanks for the project.
You would need to follow the guide to add manifest.json. Please see the instructions here: https://ui5.sap.com/#/topic/3a9babace121497abea8f0ea66e156d9
Then, as a second step, you will have to migrate the project by following the instructions present here https://help.sap.com/viewer/17d50220bcd848aa854c9c182d65b699/Latest/en-US/70d41f3ee29d453a90efab3ce025d450.html

Hi ,
To further investigate your issue, will it be possible for you to attach your project from WebIDE (without the steps you have done for migration).

Regards,
 2021-04-28 14:53:34 -  (I327556) (Internal Info)
Dear Colleagues,

I had a discussion with  and the current situation is that the customer app doesn't have manifest.json file yet so the following guide is not acceptable yet:
https://help.sap.com/viewer/17d50220bcd848aa854c9c182d65b699/Latest/en-US/70d41f3ee29d453a90efab3ce025d450.html
We should first help to the customer how to create the manifest.json and then the migration should be done properly.

As these topic belong to component CA-UX-IDE I changed it to have the ticket on the proper one. Would you please help to the customer to be able to migrate their project to BAS?

Thank you and best regards,  2021-04-28 14:53:33 -  (I327556) (External Info)

 and ,
There is no user in logon depot for the backend TID, so I could not check there either. I checked in the other incident and couldn't find any indication which file is getting a 404 as well.
It will help a lot to know what the request is that is being made and getting the 404, along with it's contents, so please capture and upload the following:
end to end trace of the deployment issue:

An HTTP trace (HAR/HWL file) captured per the instructions of KBA 2505725. Capture from before just deployment through the issue occurring. Please also upload the browser's console log, cleared before deployment.

SCC payload trace file... please go to the Log and Trace Files tab of SCC admin, press Edit (pencil icon), and set Payload Trace as checked, and Cloud Connector Loggers to Debug. After reproduction, download the file that has "traffic_trace" in the name
ICM level 3 trace from the ABAP backend. Please set the log to level 3 (Goto > Trace Level > Set), then reset the file (Goto > Trace File > Reset) right before reproducing the issue. After reproduction, download the resulting ICM trace (Goto > Trace File > Save Locally).
let us know the user ID that was used for the deployment set credentials in the logon depot for TID (ABAP deployment target) for a technical user that has access to SLG1, /iwfnd/maint_service, /iwfnd/error_log.
The above trace may be more than required (SCC traffic trace probably is sufficient), but I prefer to go ahead and get the whole trace in case we need further logs later, and to cut down on further back and forth.

Thank you,  SAP Support 2023-03-08 21:37:12 -  (I830433) (External Info)
,
It wasn't clear to me that you were referring to (in the Description text) the attachments from the previous case. I have reviewed these, and don't see the issue... you would need a traffic trace from SCC (payload trace = yes on log and trace files tab) rather than the other logs, as the http access log doesn't capture tunnel http traffic, only the SCC Admin traffic.
I am going to check the backend to see if I can get further ideas on what request the 404 error is for, then how to proceed from there.

Thank you,  SAP Support 2023-03-08 20:13:01 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi Which attachments are you interested in ? In the other incident we have joint 24 attachments and I cannot download and upload all of them in this ticket. Thank you Regards  2023-03-08 19:11:39 -  (I830433) (External Info)

The attachments did not come through. Can you please attach them so I can check the files. Hopefully we can tell which request is getting a 404 from these files to check deeper.

Hi ,
When trying to install the Fiori Generators provided by SAP in VSCode (using the install button), it gets stuck on ‘installing’.
(See attached Image 1)
Manually installing the generator from the console is also not possible, but does provide an error-message, stating that the certificates to the URL where the generators are located has expired: (See attached Image 2)

A quick check on said URL shows this assertion is correct, as the certificate on npm.sap.com has expired since end of April: (See attached Image 3)
We’ve ensured that the Fiori Tools (provided by SAP) installed in VSCode are up to date. Furthermore the latest versions of Yeoman and the MTA package are installed

Please update the certificates on the SAP server or update the tools to reference a different location like: https://registry.npmjs.org/@sap%2fgenerator-fiori. The latter is the location on the internet the URL is redirected to within the browser. However, this redirection does not work appear to work in VSCode and is therefor not a solution to the problem.

Product Area selected: SAP Business Application Studio Component selected (Manual Selection): CA-UX-IDE --- Description --- Hi Support-team, We have started using the Business application studio for Fiori / SAPUI5 frontend development. A couple of weeks ago we were able to deploy the application on our on-premise Fiori Frontend system via command "abap-deploy", what worked pretty good. Now, it seems that the command is not working any longer. The command returns "bash: abap-deploy: command not found". After some googleing we found out that the "abap-deploy" command should not be used any longer in Business application studio, what explains the behaviour. (KBA 3080040, the abap-deploy command is deprecated. Instead we need to use the "npm run deploy" tool to deploy Fiori applications to ABAP. There's also a reference to help: https://help.sap.com/viewer/17d50220bcd848aa854c9c182d65b699/Latest/en-US/1b7a3be8d99c45aead90528ef472af37.html) As an alternative, we tried to create an deployment configuration with the @sap/ux-ui5-tooling & @sap/fiori:deploy-config => fiori add deploy-config. The configuration in file ui5-deploy.yaml was successfully created (see attachment) but we receive an error: Cannot get transport configuration from the backend Error: Request failed with status code 403 When trying to deploy ("npm run deploy") an other 403 error is returned. ERR! builder:custom deploy-to-abap Deployment Failed. ERR! builder:custom deploy-to-abap Request failed with status code 403 We went trough the instructions as given in https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_FIORI_tools/17d50220bcd848aa854c9c182d65b699/c06b9cbb3f3641aabfe3a5d199e855a0.html?locale=en-US Is this a known issue or how can we solve this?

Short update on this: The assumption was correct. We configured one on-premise AS as internal hosts in cloud connector. The means that we have identified the root cause which seems to be the web dispatcher. I am still waiting for a response of my SAP operation colleagues to have a look at the log of the web dispatcher. Will keep you updated! Kind regards,  2022-05-17 20:30:46 -  (I830561) (Internal Info)
Having problem upload entire log file traffic_trace_e2a39881-0119-4a5c-b625-5e0d10078f16_on_cf.eu20.hana.ondemand.com. The relevant http request/response is uploaded in cloudconnectorlog.txt file. 2022-05-17 18:46:49 -  (I830561) (External Info)
Dear customer,
Please find the summary of our call today. Findings: - The internal hosts configured in cloud connector are behind SAP Web Dispatcher.
- SAP web dispatcher returned 403 Forbidden error when querying ATO settings

/sap/bc/adt/ato/settings as well as the actual deploy service ABAP_REPOSITORY_SRV.
- Odata service calls through cloud destination are successful when sending query from the launched Fiori app project.
- The web dispatch 403 error is logged in the attached traffic_trace_e2a39881-0119-4a5c-b625-5e0d10078f16_on_cf.eu20.hana.ondemand.com - We also tried to log the error during deploy config after receiving response from ATO setting request. The error also shows the 403 error was from web dispatcher.

Next steps: - Customer try to directly configure the on-premise system as internal hosts in cloud connector. If it works, this will help to confirm the root cause is in web dispatcher.
- Customer will involve expertises to check if there is misconfig in web dispatcher.
-  will reach out to find if any SAP colleagues or teams have knowledge on web dispatcher that can help on this issue.

Best regards,

Hello ,

I will schedule a meeting next week in the time frame 7-10 am (PDT). But first I need to check available resources on our SAP Platform team and ask who is willing to join. Have a good weekend!
Kind regards,

I tested the ATO settings query: At the beginning I received a http 403 error, what was caused by the not activated SICF service "/sap/bc/adt". After the activation I called https://fioridev.corp.trumpf.com/sap/bc/adt/ato/settings?sap-client=001 and the following XML was returned: http://www.sap.com/adt/ato"/> The project also has oData service involved: The backend services of the app are called by another destination (with noAuth) when we do test execution triggered in the business application studio environment. Whenever we call the app, we need to sign-in  in order to authentifcate to the on-prem backend system. Still getting the same error. I already did an STAUTHTRACE and had a look at the /IWFND/ERROR_LOG - but no more information given. 2022-05-11 16:31:36 -  (I830561) (External Info)
Dear customer,
Some more info I would like to add to my previous message. When you test the ATO settings query (http:// : /sap/bc/adt/ato/settings?sap-client= ), please make sure you use the same on-prem user credential you used for BasicAuthentication destination configuration. I also would like to ask if your project involved odata queries to your on-prem system? If it works in SBAS environment, but the above tests gives NoAuthorization error, it is most likely your on-prem user account doesn't have enough permission to send the ATO setting query. "We are not able to deploy almost 1-2 weeks now and need a solution here soon. How can we speed things up?" It is a bit more complex when on-prem cloud connectivity is involved and we need to identify if the error is from cloud access or access to on-prem system.
Based on the feedback from you, my current assumption is: - You on-prem user doesn't have enough authorization to query /sap/bc/adt/ato/settings. Thus causing the 403 error. - This query is to fetch the default dev package, required package prefix letter, etc from backend for input validation and filling default package name. Since you explicitly provided the package and transport number by checking the succesfully generated ui5-deploy.yaml file (see ui5deploy.jpg), the 403 error should not be critical in this case. So I suggest you to continue running the actual deploy step with 'npm run deploy' command and see what happens.
Let's see if you can make any progress on these 2 items first. If the result comes back differently from my guesses, I would like to schedule a screen share session with you to further investigate this. Best regards, 

2022-05-11 15:13:05 -  (I830561) (External Info)
Dear customer,
It looks like the 403 error might be from on-prem backend. Could you do a test to verify? Depending on your on-prem server is http or https, please use the appropriate url: http:// : /sap/bc/adt/ato/settings?sap-client= https:// : /sap/bc/adt/ato/settings?sap-client=YourOnPremHostSapClientNumber> You only need to put the url in a browser window on a computer that have access to your on-premise system. After putting the url in a browser, you should be asked for your on-prem user credential. If the query is successful, an XML response is returned. The xml content might be shown in the browser page, or it might be a file called "settings" downloaded by your browser. If you receive NoAuthorization error, it indicates your user doesn't have access to this service, which is called during deploy-config.

This step might not be critical. I see that the ui5-deploy.yaml is generated. Have you tried to continue execute "npm run deploy" to check if deployment works?
Best regards,

Hello , I was following your suggestion and 1. Used the credentials of the cloud account in the .env file 2. Changed from NoAuth to BasicAuth by creating an new destination in the sub account. Unfortunately, I am still getting the same 403 error. See the screenshot attached. Another note to the cloud user: We are using AzureIDP as an Identity Provider. Therefore i set the credentials of my AzureIDP account in the .env file. Do you have any other idea?
We are not able to deploy almost 1-2 weeks now and need a solution here soon. How can we speed things up?

Kind regards,
 2022-05-10 23:04:32 -  (I830561) (External Info)
Hi ,
Thanks for the information you provided. Please see my replies below. "But once again, I assume that this file is not taken into considoration. In the official documentation, there is a note that a reference to the .env file should be set in the ui5.yaml file." The path to .env file doesn't need to be referenced in ui5.yaml. You only need to refer to the username and password environment variables in the credential section of ui5.yaml. You have done this part properly by checking the attached files you provided. "We are using basic auth for the authentification on the on-prem system, therefore I set the credentials of the on-prem system in the .env file." "In general: For the authentification on the BAS we have configured a central identity provider, which is AzureIDP. But there is no principle propagation configured. So there is no mapping between the AzureIDP user and the On-Premise identity, what makes a seperate authentification necessary?!" The user credential you put to .env file should be the cloud user credential you authenticate your BAS. A principle propagation will be required for the deployment. "I was not asked to provide any user credentials. I just set the user credentials of the on-prem system in the .env file. " "I did not attach a dest.json file :)  The settings you pasted as json does not match with our system information. " My bad. I mixed the attachments from yours and another customer. Now I see you have NoAuthentication option in the destination configuration (see destination_ffd.jpg you provided). This means you do not provide on-prem user credential in your destination configuration, and thus requires on principle propagation to map your cloud user onto on-prem user in order to access the on-prem system. "There are additonal properties like "WebIDEExposedHost" or "WebIDESystem". These properties should not affect deploy. To sum up, my suggestion would be:
1. Use your cloud user credential in .env file.
2. Instead of configuring principle propagation, let's try to get the end-to-end deploy scenario to work first. So I would suggest you to use BasicAuthentication instead of NoAuthentication in your destination configuration. When you are asked for user credentials, you provide your on-prem user credential. Once this scenario is working, you can try to setup principle propagation. Best regards,

Hi ,
Please see the customer's response.

Hi SAP, We are using basic auth for the authentification on the on-prem system, therefore I set the credentials of the on-prem system in the .env file. But once again, I assume that this file is not taken into considoration. In the official documentation, there is a note that a reference to the .env file should be set in the ui5.yaml file.
=> Do you know how this can be done?

In general: For the authentification on the BAS we have configured a central identity provider, which is AzureIDP. But there is no principle propagation configured. So there is no mapping between the AzureIDP user and the On-Premise identity, what makes a seperate authentification necessary?! "The other possibility I noticed is your destination configuration in dest.json you attached. You configured to use BasicAuthentication. When you chose BasicAuthentication, you should have been asked to provide a user credential. Please make sure you provided a valid user that can authorize to the on-prem system." => I was not asked to provide any user credentials. I just set the user credentials of the on-prem system in the .env file. I did not attach a dest.json file :)  The settings you pasted as json does not match with our system information. => Did you might mix up the tickets?! There are additonal properties like "WebIDEExposedHost" or "WebIDESystem". => Which properties are really neccessary for the deployment?

Kind regards,  2022-05-09 17:06:57 -  (I830561) (External Info)
Dear customer,
Your scenario is to deploy the fiori project to on-prem system via sap cloud platform. This scenario has two user account involved: 1) A sap cloud platform user account, and 2) and user account for your on-prem server. And a user mapping needs to be maintained between 1 and 2 so that your on-prem system can authorize your sap cloud platform user account. Your configuration looks good to me. So I am suspecting the user account might not be correct. The user credential in .env file should be the sap cloud platform user that has mapping maintained on your on-prem system. Please confirm what user credential you used in the .env file: - Is it a valid user credential that you can directly authenticate to the on-prem system?
- Or it is a user account that you can login to your SAP cloud platform account?

The other possibility I noticed is your destination configuration in dest.json you attached. You configured to use BasicAuthentication. When you chose BasicAuthentication, you should have been asked to provide a user credential. Please make sure you provided a valid user that can authorize to the on-prem system. This option uses the on-prem user credential you provided to authorize sap cloud platform to access you on-prem system. If you have provided a valid sap cloud platform user credential in .env file, this scenario should work without user mapping between your sap cloud user and on-prem user.

We tried these already, before opening the case. But we may did something wrong. Added the credentials to ui5-deploy.ymal and an ,env file for the user/password - see screenshots attached. In the instrcution it was mentioned that we need to set a reference to the .env file from the ui5.yaml. We havent done this? Is this necessary?  If yes how is the reference set? 2022-05-05 14:40:08 -  (I313281) (External Info)
Solution provided. Awaiting customer's response. 2022-05-05 14:39:42 -  (I313281) (External Info)
Dear Customer,

This looks like there is a problem with a service that requires authentication, but credentials are either incorrect or not provided.

Our experts have pointed out that an .env file with correct credentials may resolve this issue, as described here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sap/ux-ui5-tooling#user-content-setting-environment-variables-in-a-env-file

Please let us know if this resolves your issue.

Dear Customer,

From the attached screenshots, it's unclear how the application preview is being triggered. It's not obvious if the necessary dependencies are correctly installed either.
Can you please try the following and report back?
1. From the command palette in BAS, run the command "Fiori: Open Application Info"
2. Check the information in the "Application Status" section and perform any recommended actions there
3. Click on "Preview Application" after any pending actions have been taken

If you're still facing issues, can you please attach the project to the incident (please remember to skip the node_modules folder).

The error reported is: An unexpected error occurred, Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'dataSource'). Note - I've checked outside of Hydro and it is working on our release of S/4HANA as a source, so possibly related to something to do with our authentication (we have SAML2 involved, but this usually bypasses this and uses the saved username/password fine. Please note - If I recreate the project, it loads the metadata file fine - it's just failing when I want to refresh the metadata locally (so the autocompletion works for entity information). Attached is the a project with this problem.

Dear Customer,

I'm  from SAP Support. I would recommend to take a look at the KBA:
3111620 - BAS Fiori application preview cannot access data source: 404 Cannot GET /xxx/yyy

It talks about the opposite of your issue when the call doesn't work from preview but works when it deployed. But the point is the same. The configuration of the preview and of the deployed application are in separated files.

As you can see for the preview you have to configure in the ui5.yaml.
The deployed application is using the approuter that is configured in the xs-app.json.

Hello Mr. Önnheim, Is this problem still present? My colleague  could not reproduce it, but is on vacation now. I tried the same, but without success - no exception was visible except at the right start, because of the specification module not being part of your project (in its zipped version). But this could be solved by entering npm i @sap/ux-specification --save-dev in the root folder, as indicated in the output log of the application modeler. This installs the specification version 1.90.14 which you originally mentioned, but I see no further exception when working with the page editor for the various apps. If you still see any problem, please let us know by providing a step-by-step instruction. Best regards,  2021-12-07 09:11:27 -  (D062812) (External Info)

Solution provided: Hi ,

Thank you for your patience.  Great to hear that you have overcome this obstacle. Please be assured that in the background there has been a lot of investigation into this issue.

In turns out that the intermittent issue causing the 500 error was also the same reason why the result of deployment failed and returned with an error that the repository already existed.

The intermittent issue has been fixed by our BAS colleagues, and I'm very hopeful that this also means your deployments should be successful from now on.

Please do let us know if you are still having the same issue.  I will mark this as resolved for now, as the underlying issue has been rectified.
Best regards,

2022-10-21 07:57:04 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hello , Thanks for the Work around, We have tried the option of undeploying and redeploying but when we try to undeploy also we have faced the 500 error for at least 10 times yesterday. And it worked once, So we have undeployed& redeployed the changes. Can we have the details of permanent fix and the upcoming release date. Thanks,  2022-10-19 15:58:00 -  (I305274) (External Info)
Hi customer,

Thank you for reaching out. I'm from the SAP Fiori tools team and hopefully can help you resolve the issue.
Unfortunately there are 2 issues you are seeing :(.  First is that you can't redeploy an existing application.  We have identified this and it will be fixed in an upcoming release.  In order to work around this, please do one of the following:

1. You can undeploy and then re-deploy your application by doing the following:

In the root of your Fiori project, execute: npm run undeploy
This should undeploy the existing application.  You can then run:
npm run deploy

to deploy it again.

2. Otherwise, you can use /UI5/UI5_REPOSITORY_LOAD to directly upload your application.

The second issue is related to our cloud connector, and customers are seeing intermitent 500 errors when deploying or undeploying or retrieving data from their destination.   This is currently under investigation from our cloud connector colleagues.  So you may have to run the deploy or undeploy command a couple of times before it is successful.

Please let me know if this helps?

Dear ,
Customer uses the commands below to deploy their BAS application to ABAP:
npx fiori add deploy-config npm run deploy
After they do this they see one of 2 errors:
SAPUI5 ABAP Repository with name ZBACKINSTOCK already exists Request failed with status code 500
From research I found the case below in your component with the same issue, its seems the issue may be with the redeploying of an existing application and the customer needs to undeploy and then deploy the application again? Can you check this and confirm this is the solution for this customer also

Our backend UI5 is the long term supported 1.71 (till Q4/2027), hence I develop using this version. Are there any similar JavaScript fixes like for note 3227102 that get around the movement of some of the backend files (currently failing trying to load http://localhost:8080/resources/sap/ushell/Container.js with a 404 HTTP error) Note - Workaround is to use latest UI5 version which has it's own risks. To reproduce, use VSCode on your own systems, generate a 1.71.49 Analytical List Page against any OData service (V2) and try see if it works. Note - I'm not interested in getting this reproduced in our systems for you so if that's not going to get this solved - that's fine - I'll just continue to develop on the latest version of UI5 (slows me down but that's fine). Hopefully this is a known issue already.

Pulse summary information ##Categorize the Case## --Symptom-- Preview project in BAS, but error 403 access denied occurred when calling the backend service --Environment-- Business Application Studio --Business impact-- Dear Support, The app project is stopped due to this situation --Case contacts-- Name:  Role: REPORTER Email: *EMAIL* Business phone: *PHONE* ##Investigate & Diagnose## --Research (internal)-- -- SWARM 5636 (Internal) --
Reason: 403 Access Denied Session id: No session. Requestor: *SAP-ID* Participants: (*SAP-ID*), (*SAP-ID*) Origin Component: CA-BAS-AUT Other Components: Status: Open Pulse Updated: 2022-06-15 06:46:07Z (UTC)
-------------------------
1. In the destination configuration, RFC_USER is configured to login S4/HANA system, the strange thing is when the service is called by BAS, RFC_USER should be used, not CC user. 2. The other thing need to check is the request URL in network trace, seems the "Majore" should not be involved.
Ask for project source code to check related configuration ##Planned Next Steps## State: Open Planned Next Step: Analysis Responsible: SAP Product Support Next Status Update: 06/24/2022 17:00:00 Created: 06/21/2022 13:52:49 2022-06-30 16:38:15 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Solution provided: Hi,
Thank you for taking the call today.
I understand it was a learning curve to get your app migrated from NEO and deployed to Cloud Foundry and I will relate this back to our product owners so we can work on creating better documentation for this flow.
The outstanding issue is configuring your FLP site, please refer to this tutorial group which will guide you through setting up your FLP site;
https://developers.sap.com/group.dsag-cloud-dev-day-cf.html
Refer to the tutorial "Integrate Your SAP Fiori Elements App into a New Launchpad Site".
I will resolve this issue as your root cause has been indentified and resolved.
Thanks.

Hi,
Can we organise a call to do a sharing session? I think there is confusion over how the destinations and xs-app.json are mapped when deployed to Cloud Foundry.
Please email *EMAIL* with details of the meeting. Im on annual leave tomorrow but available today or again anytime next week. Im located in Ireland GMT+1 timezone.
 2022-06-30 13:38:38 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi, We changed the xs-app.json as you told us but it didn't work. After, we tried to create a destination with the same name as in the origin NEO SYSTEM, where it's named "Majorel". Then, we changed the files to point to the destination "Majorel" in place of "_s4_DES_DESARROLLO". The destination is SAML. Now the problem is the same and obtain an "Authentication error". When we call the APIS, directly to S4HC it works, now and before... the problem is always when we call the APIS from BAS or CF  throw destination. The current xs-app.json file has this code, because the destination is "Majorel": "routes": [ { "source": "^/Majorel/(.*)$", "target": "/$1", "destination": "Majorel", "authenticationType": "", "csrfProtection": false }, _______ The second problem is that the migration tool does not work. I have find this link talking about the same problem. https://answers.sap.com/questions/13667809/bas-migrate-project-for-use-in-fiori-tools-makes-b.html I have restarted the devspace and it has worked again. Now, when I choose preview application, appears a popup asking for the nameuser and password but no user works. I have checked with S4HC users and S Users. It returns a 403 error.
This is the call that returns the error: https://port8080-workspaces-ws-p26t7.eu10.applicationstudio.cloud.sap/Majorel/sap/opu/odata/sap/API_PURCHASEORDER_PROCESS_SRV/$metadata?sap-client=080&sap-language=EN If I check the APP from the link in the "Managed Application Router" section in BTP: https://-test-hew42olm.launchpad.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/19199232-ec8a-4600-8bbb-c6855f019371.com--m-carga_pedidos_compra.comsothismcarga_pedidos_compra-1.0.0/index.html It returns an 403 error. Same error from launchpad. Regards. 2022-06-30 10:50:08 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi, There seems to be two issues at play now. If we address the first issue with _S4_DES_DESARROLLO, you were able to retrieve the v2 catalog. In the document `Connection problem from BTP to S4HC_V1.docx` the destination was configured with Basic Auth. This worked locally in preview mode but failed when deployed to CF. This failed due to the wrong host specified in the xs-app.json as the path included  in the path. For example, the correct CF route is { "source": "^/Majorel/(.*)$", "target": "/$1", "destination": "_S4_DES_DESARROLLO", "authenticationType": "", "csrfProtection": false }, Your second issue is now related to using migration and SAML. 1. migration The reason migration is not working is because you have a dependency @sap/ux-ui5-tooling added to your package.json. This is not available on WebIDE so apps coming from this target system wouldn't have this added to their config. If you remove this dependency, then you can re-run migration again. 2. SAML So using the dynamic link should work but requires additional properties/headers etc to be present. You are assuming that using your current SAP BTP session will provide these headers. There are additional steps for you to ensure the API request is correct. I would suggest using postman to ensure you have the correct headers/tokens in order to correctly validate your new destination using SAMLAssertion Please refer to the following links for more help https://blogs.sap.com/2021/10/28/btp-private-linky-swear-with-azure-propagate-your-sap-principels/ https://blogs.sap.com/2021/12/01/s-4hana-cloud-apis-with-clientcertificateauthentication./ Yes, we can setup a sharing session but I will only be able to support you on the first issue. The second issue with SAML configuration is not an area our team supports, if you are unable to configure the SAMLAssertion destination correctly I would need to re-assign your ticket to a different component.  2022-06-29 15:32:16 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi support, I have followed you indications but it doesn't work. Attached is a document with the configuration and procedure followed. Additionally, the migration tool is not working now. Is there any problem with it? Please, tell us if it would be better to have a meeting to solve the problem. Thanks. 2022-06-27 15:17:28 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
Can we please clarify the following;
1. Local Prevew Mode
You previosuly mentioned, local preview mode work? Is this still the case?
2. Deploying to Cloud Foundry
This is not working even with the latest changes applied to your xs-app.json as this had the incorrect path? Is this correct?
3. Authentication type
Have you changed your destination configuration? The destination config is showing  but the latest scree shot is showing SAML Assertion. Can you please attach the latest SAP BTP subaccount destination properties for _S4_DES_DESARROLLO
3. Independently validate your SAP BTP destination configuration
Please follow these steps;
Note: Please ensure you have subscribed to the Launchpad Service before proceeding
1. In your SAP BTP Cockpit, select your subaccount overview page
2. Note the `Subdomain` attribute i.e. `my-subdomain`
3. Note the `API endpoint` attribute i.e. https://api.cf.eu10.hana.ondemand.com thus the region in this case will be `eu10`
4. Select `Destinations` under `Connectivity` tab on the left navigation bar
5. Filter the destinations using the name of your chosen destination
6. Select your destination i.e. `MyDestination`
7. Select `Edit`
8. Set the following `Additional Properties`, if not already set;
HTML5.DynamicDestination: true
WebIDEEnabled: true
9. Select `Save`, please ensure you have the client secret if required
10. Generate the link as follows, replacing the four values as follows;
https://.launchpad.cfapps..hana.ondemand.com/dynamic_dest/ /
For example:
Single OData Service
https://my-subdomain.launchpad.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/dynamic_dest/MyDestination/sap/opu/odata/sap/My_Business_Service/$metadata
Replace `My_Business_Service` with the specific name of your OData Service
OData Catalog V2
https://my-subdomain.launchpad.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/dynamic_dest/MyDestination/sap/opu/odata/IWFND/CATALOGSERVICE;v=2/ServiceCollection
OData Catalog V4
https://my-subdomain.launchpad.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/dynamic_dest/MyDestination/sap/opu/odata4/iwfnd/config/default/iwfnd/catalog/0002/ServiceGroups?$expand=DefaultSystem($expand=Services)
11. Open a new browser tab, to validate the URL is working i.e. assuming its an OData Service, XML should be returned

Hi Support, I have changed and deployed the APP but the error is the same. I think there must be another problem in the backend system or in the destination because when I execute the APP, the call reaches the backend and the error is stored in the LOG APP (in S4HC). When I try to create a new APP in BTP and  I choose Logical System and the destination "_S4_DES_DESARROLLO", It returns an authentication error in the same way the APP. It's seems that the user don't have permisions in the backend. Attached is the screenshot of the BAS Service Center for _S4_DES_DESARROLLO. It displays that V2 and V4 catalog Status are not available. Kind regards. 2022-06-24 08:48:19 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
I've managd to open the tar file and I can see the following in the application xs-app.json

{
"source": "^/Majorel/(.*)$",
"target": "/Majorel/$1",
"destination": "_S4_DES_DESARROLLO",
"authenticationType": "",
"csrfProtection": false
},

Based on previous correspodance, Majorel is not a valid path exposed by your destination. In your manifest.json you have the following;

/Majorel/sap/opu/odata/sap/API_PURCHASEORDER_PROCESS_SRV/

But the Majorel is possbily the name of another destination on webide? But this needs to be removed from any calls to your backend exposed by _S4_DES_DESARROLLO.

Thus the change should be the following which is drop the Majorel from the target API call

{
"source": "^/Majorel/(.*)$",
"target": "/$1",
"destination": "_S4_DES_DESARROLLO",
"authenticationType": "",
"csrfProtection": false
},

In theory your existing config will make the following call;

_S4_DES_DESARROLLO/Majorel/sap/opu/odata/sap/API_PURCHASEORDER_PROCESS_SRV/

Instead it should be;

_S4_DES_DESARROLLO/sap/opu/odata/sap/API_PURCHASEORDER_PROCESS_SRV/

where $1 is the path defined in your manifest.json with Majorel dropped.
Please retry with this change and rebuild/redeploy your application.

Hi,
Just to confirm, the issue with local preview in the BAS is now working?
In relation to Cloud Foundry deployment, can you please complete the following;
Reproduce the issue in your browser and attach a full network trace (.har file) with all requests in the reproduced scenario you are referring to; https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/1990706
Please note, I'm having issues with tar files, you can run the following command to produce a zip of your project without the node_modules folder which is the main bulk of the zip and is NOT required;
zip -r feproject.zip ./ / -x */\.* *.git* \.* *.zip *.env* *.mta *.rb *.bak *.swp *.DS_Store *.back *.merge *.txt *.sh **/resources/\* **/mta-op-*/\* **/gen/\* **/node_modules/\* **/mta_archives/\* **/dist/\* **/.ABAPDeployResources/\* **/.vscode/\*
Another option is from SAP Business Application Studio, open command palette via View -> Find Command and enter "Fiori: Open Environment Check" -> Select your specific project
Please attach the generated zip file.
Thanks.

Product Area selected: SAP S/4HANA foundation > UI Technologies Component selected (Manual Selection): CA-UX-IDE --- Description --- Hello SAP , We are in process of upgrading our landscape from S4H OP 1909 SP 02  to  S4H  OP 2021 SP 02 . Presently as part of our AS-IS process , we have automation test scripts to execute test cases through Fiori UI ( Selenium UI test cases ) and  ( created as tile in FLP ) Now after upgrading an environment  , all of the automated test cases are failing due to reasons v.i.z. mismatch of titles , labels,  etc . Please provide the best practices for UI Automation Testing through Fiori and  ,  which would be upgrade agnostic .

Also please suggest if the below approach is recommended for automated testing . 1. Using Stable ID attribute to locate a particular element on the web page. 2. Incase Stable ID is not available , using combination of label and UI element to identify the control uniquely on the web page. Please confirm if the Stable ID and HTML ID attribute are same in Fiori and what is its equivalent in  . Eg. of stable id in . Eg. of stable id in Fiori

2022-10-20 13:00:30 -  (D035602) (External Info)
Solution provided: Dear customer,
It definitely makes sense to use stable IDs to make the tests more robust. In your example the stable ID most likely would be sap.suite.ui.generic.template.ListReport.view.ListReport::ZCDSV_C_SCM_PLNEXT--listReportFilter-filterItemControl_BASIC-subm_date_time> but that could be totally different for e.g. freestyle apps. Regarding  I'm not aware of such an equivalent.
I think it would be best to reach out to the Selenium community to get best practices for using this tool in combination with S/4HANA.
Sorry for not being able to provide you more support here. Kind regards,

Hi ,
The solution worked!

Hi,
Thank you for the attached files; your issue is related to the path used in your controller.
If you refer to the HAR file attached, the API ZPM_APONTAMENTO_SRV endpoint is calling the relative path;
https://devmrsmobile.cpp.cfapps.us21.hana.ondemand.com/sap/opu/odata/SAP/ZPM_APONTAMENTO_SRV/$metadata
/sap is not exposed on the cfapps endpoint. Now, if you look at the metadata call being made to pull the metadata for your mainSource defined in the manifest.json, its calling the absoluate path;
https://devmrsmobile.cpp.cfapps.us21.hana.ondemand.com/be1d5681-6e01-4688-ba96-b418db6be2f4.zpmapon_approuter.mrscombrzpmapon-0.0.1/sap/opu/odata/sap/ZPM_APONTAMENTO_SRV/$metadata?sap-language=EN
You need to update your service URL and remove the leading forward slash.
Please refer to this question for more information.

Hope this resolves your issue.

Dear Colleagues,
Could you please kindly help to check further?
Description:
An Fiori application is developed by customer, standalone approuter is used, it is deployed to Cloud Foundry, but 404 not found error occurred when trying to open the application.
Curl backend service in BAS terminal returns 200OK, please check Results 3-1.docx in attachment.

Solution provided: Hi,
Root cause was how the original destination was configured. It was configured as an odata_abap catalog but the S4hana endpoint is not returning v4 services thus the Fiori Tools service list will not be populated.
A work around was to clone the destination and configure it as a partial URL i.e. remove abap properties and replace it with odata_gen. The URL was updated with the host and the partial service path.
The user was able to create a Fiori Elements application using this new destination.
Customer was able to proceed as normal.

Hi,

Hi , what do you mean with $H2O_URL ? Is this a placeholder? Can we schedule a meeting, I'm most of time available, also now, please call via Teams. Thanks in advance  2022-05-09 16:17:53 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
So part of the issue why the Fiori Tools is not showing the services is that we are expecting a v4 and v2 services. Both of these API calls are made when you select a BTP destinaton based on the properties of your destination i.e. odata_abap signals that v2 and/or v4 services are available against this endpoint.
However, in your case the v4 catalog is returning a 403 so none of the services are displayed and is the reason you are getting no services listed.
A number of options available; Option 1. To unblock you, can you create a Fiori Elements application using the following OData Service URL, for the Data source select Connect to an OData Service instead of Connect to a System https://$H2O_URL/destinations/S4Hana_Quality_LabelApp/sap/opu/odata/sap/API_PRODUCTION_ORDER_2_SRV/
Option 2. To confirm the v2 services are being retreived, select SAPUI5 Freestlye application type, select SAP Fiori List-Detail Application, select S4Hana_Quality_LabelApp as the datasource. This will only show the v2 services as the template is not dependent on V4 services.
Option 3. In relation to your error, there is an SAP article around this https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/0002954378 and https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/0002928752 which refers to activiting sap/opu/odata4 ICF node through SICF t-code.
These issues are not related to Fiori Tools as you also have issues with the Service Centre not displaying the services. If these options do not help you, please let me know and I will try to find another team who have more experience in the area of configuring S4Hana cloud systems.

Hi , if the "basic authentication" is not working then please help what I can do in S4Hana Cloud. Your provided URL (SAP Blog entry) is not valid for S4 Hana Cloud! In S4Hana Cloud I don't have a chance to change Cloud Connector and also not the possibility to set addition roles and I cannot modify IWBEP SICF service! S4 Hana Cloud is not the same as SAP $H on Premise ERP system. I have only Fiori apps in S4HC to customize it. I tried a lot but all without any success. I also delete trust configuration to force correct login with. I have no idea how i can this problem. I tried a few times to connect S4H with BTP and it works fine.
Only with S4HCloud  I have this problems. Our provided suggestion fits not to root cause. Please help. 2022-05-03 15:37:22 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
Based on your exposed destinations here are some of my findings;

Based on last comment, it seems that basisauthentication is not working as you expect, I would suggest looking at this blog to determine if you are using  and  correctly;

Hi , here my results.
You ask:"the service centre did not display any of the 56" -> No, only what you see in screenshot."Did it prompt you for a username and password?" -> No"Also, when completing the environment check, did it prompt you for the username and password?" -> No
API Endpoint: https://api.cf.eu10.hana.ondemand.com Subdomain: mhquality Org Name: mh_mhquality
Destination: S4Hana_Quality_LabelApp HTML5.DynamicDestination: true         (was already done) WebIDEEnabled: true          (additional property set) WebIDEUsage: odata_abap,dev_abap,ui5_execute_abap  (additional property set)
https://mhquality.launchpad.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/dynamic_dest/S4Hana_Quality_LabelApp/sap/opu/odata/sap/API_PRODUCTION_ORDER_2_SRV/$metadata
it works perfect and results with correct XML. See enclosed screenshot metadata_result.png But maybe important for: When I try it in incognito modus then SAP ask for credentials and an additional window popup to select "Default identiy provider" or other trust configuration! See enclosed screenshot Login_Credentials.png. After selecting "Default identiy provider" it works also with my S-User. It works not for user "LABEL_TYPE_APP" defined in Communication Arrangement of S4H Cloud. Best regards,  2022-04-29 14:22:11 -  (I313149) (External Info)

Hi,
Thank you for the attachments. In both the environment check and the service centre, the V4 catalog returned a 403 which is why they are not being listed.
Based on the attached screenshot, the service centre did not display any of the 56  v2 services? Did it prompt you for a username and password?
Also, when completing the environment check, did it prompt you for the username and password?
The final step to validate if your ABAP environment is configured correctly with the appropriate privileges is to independently validate the destination. Please follow these steps, please report back with any screen shots were applicable;
1. In your SAP BTP Cockpit, select your subaccount overview page
2. Note the `Subdomain` attribute i.e. `my-subdomain`
3. Note the `API endpoint` attribute i.e. https://api.cf.eu10.hana.ondemand.com thus the region in this case will be `eu10`
4. Select `Destinations` under `Connectivity` tab on the left navigation bar
5. Filter the destinations using the name of your chosen destination
6. Select your destination i.e. `MyDestination`

Hi , I enclosed Screenshots and also env_check.zip file for you. In summery V2 Catalog Service is available with 56 services. V4 is not available, not sure what BAS needs (v2 or v4) in Fiori application wizzard. Best regards,  2022-04-28 15:14:14 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
After reviewing your attached documents,  the destination properties look ok!
There are some additional steps you can perform to help with connection issues on SBAS and will provide output that can be attached here.
To use SAP Fiori Tools Environment Check;
1. From SAP Business Application Studio, open command palette via View -> Find Command and enter "Fiori: Open Environment Check" -> Enter credentials if prompted -> Choose a location to save
2. A generated "Preview results.md" file is opened. Please check the section "Destination Details". SAP Fiori tools Environment Check will find and suggest if any destination parameters are missing.
A second option;
1. In Business Application Studio, select the `Service Centre` tab on the left navigation bar, select your destination, if configured correctly, the service and system properties will be returned
2. Please take screenshots of the services or system properties that are loaded
Thanks.
Thanks

Hi BAS colleagues,

Palram wants to deploy an html5 application for SAP Managed , as you can see the attached mta contains a wrong mta.yaml (no destination deployer, HTML5_runtime_enabled = false, etc.).
Please help customer to model the mta properly.
I also recommend to teach first level support how to support customers using this flow.

Dear colleagues,
Could you please help check further? Thank you so much.
Customer is trying to deploy a new ui5 app to the CF. The application can be deployed successfully to CF space. They hope the application should be displayed under BTP "HTML5 Applications" tab. But cannot achieve that.

I have shared the following document with customer. Customer has attached the mtar file in the incident.
---------------------------------
You can create a non-UI5 HTML5 application, run it locally, build, and deploy the application.
Developing an HTML5 Application for Cloud Foundry

Could you please help check if ui5 app is supposed to be displayed under BTP "HTML5 Applications" tab?
Searched internally, but cannot find any similar case. I ran out of idea. Can you guide how to process further?

Dear ,
Thank you for the update.
From the attachment(NoApplication.PNG), seems you are developing HTML5 Applications for SAP Launchpad service.
If my understanding is right, then when you create a project in SAP Business Application Studio (or your IDE of choice), you must provide the SAP Cloud Service value. And please ensure the value of sap.app/id and sap.cloud/service must be unique. For the details, please refer to the following documents:
The value of sap.app/id of each application must be unique across all spaces in the subaccount. The value of sap.cloud/service of each application must be unique across all HTML5 repository instances, MTA files, and destinations.
Expose HTML5 Applications in SAP Launchpad service
Developing HTML5 Applications and Extensions
Also please refer to the KBA ##3144214 to check the issue.
If my understanding is wrong, then could you please help provide more information? the HTML5 Application content provider is not visible (missing) under Site Manager Provider Manager? or please let me know where is the HTML5 application missing.

Hi ,

The documentation of Page Editor maybe misleading. There's no need to do anything in JSON, if you don't want to. There is a GUI to help you edit the properties that is shown by default.
This is what a sample project I have in my workspace looks like (see attachment: page-editor.jpg).

Unfortunately, the Visual Editor is not supported anymore.

Let us know how this works out for you.

Cheers,

The documentation of Page Editor maybe misleading. There's no need to do anything in JSON, if you don't want to. There is a GUI to help you edit the properties that is shown by default.
This is what a sample project I have in my workspace looks like (see attachment).

Unfortunately, the Visual Editor is not supported anymore.

Let us know how this works out for you.

Cheers,

Dear Colleagues, Customer create List Report project in BAS. They say that in webide , there could use VISUAL EDITOR to configure design detail like cell size , exportexcel button, etc. However in BAS they cannot find this option. With ctrl+shift+p they can find the SAPUI5 Visual Editor, however it is not opening. I assume it cannot be used in List Report project. Could you please help to clarify?

first , I want to thank you for your answer and I want to apologize for the priority error. I don't succeed to load  Open SAPUI5 Visual Editor by any methods I have the option but any reaction no load ... 2021-05-05 09:10:54 -  (I344859) (External Info)
Dear ,
Please try the below steps: Load the Visual Editor.

Press Ctrl + Shift + P to open the command palette, and search for Open SAPUI5 Visual Editor and select it. The other option to open the visual editor is to expand the webapp folder, right click the manifest.appdescr_variant file, and choose Open SAPUI5 Visual Editor. When doing this for the first time, an information message will appear, asking to expose a port needed for the Visual Editor. Select Yes.

Please also note, that an incident should be categorized with the priority "very high" if the problem has very serious consequences for normal business processes or IT processes related to core business processes. Urgent work cannot be performed.
This is generally caused by the following circumstances:
- A productive system is completely down.
- The imminent system go-live or upgrade of a production system can't be completed.
- The customer's core business processes are seriously affected.
- And for each circumstance a workaround is not available.
As currently the above criteria is not met, according to our policy I would like to ask you to reduce the priority from Very High. Kind regards,  SAP Product Support

Sorry to hear that you are having problems launching the Fiori generator.  It * like it failed to install in your dev space.  Can you please try the following:

- Click 'View -> Find Command' from the menu and search for `Open Template Wizard`.

- This will show you all the generators that are installed in your dev space.

- 'SAP Fiori application` should be one of the generators installed.  If it is not installed, please check if there is a message at the bottom saying "Generators are being installed in the background", and wait for that to complete.

*@SAP/generator-fiori` and wait for the generator to install.  Then try open the template wizard again.

- If this still doesn't solve your issue, please select `View -> Output` and find the console output when the generator tries to launch.  Please post the console output in this issue for investigation. 2022-11-29 09:20:35 -  (I012956) (External Info)
Hi,

Thanks for providing those logs. I cant see anything specific there either, so there are some further things we can check and steps we can do.
First can I clarify if you have done the following:
- closed the Application Wizard ('Project from Template') window and re-opened the Wizard
- stopped the dev space and restarted it
This is to check if restarting either the wizard or dev space resolves the issue. Assuming you have done this and the issue remains, there are some things to try as for some reason the install of the generator has not completed successfully.  That could be for a number of reasons.  Can you please do the following:
1. Try and install the Fiori generator using the Application Wizard again, but this time please ensure that the "Output" tab is open and please paste the contents of the "Application Wizard" console. If this is empty, or simply states 'installing generators...' like before proceed to next step.
2. Also, can you please try and install another generator using the Application Wizard and see if that succeeds?  For example,  "generator-easy-ui5".  If that does succeed, then the problem is specific to the Fiori generator.
3. Finally, there is a chance that the Fiori generator is installed but in a corrupt state, with only some of its libraries available.  Can you please uninstall and then reinstall the generator by doing the following:
a) Open a terminal and type `npm uninstall -g @sap/generator-fiori`.  This should uninstall the existing generator,
b) Then type `npm install -g @sap/generator-fiori`.  This will install the new generator.  Please provide details of any error message received in the terminal.
Please try the above steps and let me know if you need any clarification and if they help resolve the issue.

Kind regards,

Hi , Thanks for your response on this, I am trying all this exercise opening tool on Incognito only but still getting error while opening in visual studio. attached screenshot from igcognito window. Could you please provide addtional comment. Regards  2021-04-01 12:27:45 -  (I521152) (External Info)
Dear Customer, 1. About the problem with the opening of the Visual Editor - it is currently a known issue - you should either clear your browser cookies and session , or open brand new session (like incognito window for example) and you will be able to open it. This happens when you have authenticated and used the Visual Editor to an app from a certain system and try to open it for an app from another system. 2. About which namespace should be used: In your case, it should be the whole and full namespace property value that is in the manifest.appdescr_variant file : apps/com.bas.zsobas13/appVariants/customer.zfiori_extn/ Thank you and kind regards,  SAPUI5 Adaptation Project SAPUI5 Development Support 2021-03-31 10:25:22 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi , I am trying to open manifest.appdescr_variant in SAPUI5 visual editor to confirm changes are in place before deploying it, but it is giving me error: An error has occurred: Error: Request failed: error URI: /destinations/sap/bc/lrep/actions/getcsrftoken/ could you please provide any hint here? Also just to confirm, should i paste the complete namespace as mentioned in manifest.appdescr_variant as: apps/com.bas.zsobas13/appVariants/customer.zfiori_extn/ or just zfiori_extn ? Please confirm. Regards  2021-03-30 12:22:19 -  (I521152) (External Info)
Dear Customer, As per documentation : https://help.sap.com/viewer/584e0bcbfd4a4aff91c815cefa0bce2d/Cloud/en-US/420da4b6a7f047eea57608b0d37037ab.html - line number 6, during deployment you should use the namespace for your project, which you should get from your manifest.appdescr_variant file, from the property called 'namespace', but in your try you have used some other string ''. Please do try with the mentioned property set for namespace in the deployment tool and confirm if its working or if you have any other problems. Regards,

Product Area selected: SAP enhancement package for SAP ERP > Enterprise Technology Component selected (Manual Selection): CA-UX-IDE --- Description --- Hello My colleague opened an incident id 002075129500000043662023 regarding installing VSCODE - OFFILNE with no internet connection. I followed the instructions and I succeeded to build a new project in VSCODE - OFFILNE. My problem is as described below: When I try to run the application with command "npm start" ("file "NPM START.png"), the application is executed in the edge browser and I see an error message "sap is not defined". I also attached 2 files: "package.json" and "ui5.yaml". Best Regards,

Pulse summary information ##Categorize the Case## --Environment-- Source: portal Type: Productive System System ID/Name: PRD / PRD Product version: System managed by: onPrem Install base item: PRD Sold product: R/3 Technical Installation ##Provide Resolution## --Solution-- Dear Customer,

Thank you for reaching out.
Please find below steps which you can use to preview application in offline mode:

1] Serving UI5 sources locally

- Download UI5 sources (SAPUI5 Runtime/SAPUI5 SDK) https://tools.hana.ondemand.com/#sapui5 and transfer to your system
- Then add configuration for fiori-tools-servestatic middleware to ui5-mock.yaml file as mentioned in section Example Configuration for serving locally SAPUI5
(you need to do Empty cache and Hard reload if Readme is still show as empty)

- You can then preview application with script npm run start-mock

You can read more about Preview here in our documentation https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_FIORI_tools/17d50220bcd848aa854c9c182d65b699/b962685bdf9246f6bced1d1cc1d9ba1c.html

2] Application preview with start-local script

For this you need to run your application in a system connected with internet once.

- Transfer your project to system connected with internet
- Start preview with npm run start-local
- This will download sapui5 sources for the first time
- You will find download ui5 sources openui5 and sapui5 in
Windows -> C:\Users\ \.ui5\framework\packages
- Create same structure in your PC without internet connection and transfer these files

You can now run preview with npm run start-local without internet connection.

p.s. as already mentioned, a workaround for you is to disable the ui5 language assistant until we deliver an update 2023-03-01 08:11:18 -  (D022159) (External Info)
Hello , Your last reply confused me a bit, as your original comment was about VS Code, now you talk about WebIDE and Eclipse. Could not reach you by phone, thus let me ask my questions here: Which ui5 libraries shall be upgraded where? Is there any open requirement now from your side concerning WebIDE or Eclipse, or is your concern only about the ui5 language assistant? If the later, does the given requirement https://github.com/SAP/ui5-language-assistant/issues/520 fit to your situation? If yes, I would appreciate continuing the discussion over there - the responsible Product Owner is already informed. Note that the github issue also describes a solution approach form another customer who has set up an own internal ui5 server to supply the information e.g. to the language assistant. Thus it would be nice if you could comment over there if this approach would be feasible for you as well -  before we start implementing a solution that does not fir to your needs. Best regards,  2023-02-28 12:39:46 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi It's a problem for our organization because we use WEBIDE and ECLIPSE editors. The ui5 libraries versions which support the above editors are limited to version 1.7-1.9 and we have a requirement to upgrade these ui5 libraries version. We need ASAP solution for the extension ui5 language assistant.  2023-02-28 10:45:42 -  (D022159) (External Info)
Solution provided: Dear Customer,
As your requirement is associated with a public github resource, please formulate it under https://github.com/SAP/ui5-language-assistant/issues/520 or open a new issue at this github. Thanks,  2023-02-28 10:41:35 -  (D022159) (External Info)
P.s. I now found the existing requirement https://github.com/SAP/ui5-language-assistant/issues/520. As this is a public resource, I recommend that you directly vote or comment here. 2023-02-28 09:46:21 -  (D022159) (External Info)
Hello , I talked to the responsible Product Manager and yes, you are right:  ui5-language-assistant tries to find external links in Internet at run-time. I didn't expect this, but it  is the case. At the moment, the only workaround is to disable the ui5 language assistant -  with the negative impact of loosing LSP capabilities, I know. We will try to find another solution, but this means a feature request, and will take some time. We will keep you updated. 2023-02-28 08:46:42 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi I followed the instructions in ticket 002075129500000043662023. (I downloaded the portable VSCODE) The extension ui5-language-assistant is not working in OFFLINE. To illustrate this problem, unplug the internet cable and try to do autoComplete. You will see that errors messages are invoked when you try to do autoComplete (see fro example file attached). I think that extension ui5-language-assistant trys to find external links in Internet and that is why failed in OFFLINE. Best Regards,  2023-02-27 16:47:19 -  (D022159) (External Info)
p.s. I now saw that you already got the link to the instruction in the first ticket 002075129500000043662023. But - as there are some updates now -  it looks like you have to reiterate and actualize the portable version that is mentioned in the instruction. Note that ui5-language-assistant now is part of the Fiori Tools extension pack that you can retrieve from the VSCode market place. Thus, by updating the extension pack from there you should get the UI5 language assistant as well. 2023-02-27 15:15:25 -  (D022159) (External Info)
Hello , There is a longer description on how to establish everything offline, written by our team colleague : https://github.com/Klaus-Keller/sap-fiori-tools-offline-instructions Following this description you will hopefully get ALL node modules installed that you need. If you still face problems after that, please let us know. Best regards,  2023-02-27 09:20:43 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Dear  Thanks for your reply! Another issue regarding extension named  "UI5 Language Assistant " which doesn't work properly in OFFLINE VSCODE. See attached file "UI5 LANGUAGE ASSITANT EXTENSION.PNG" showing the problem. Best regards,  2023-02-24 22:05:32 -  (I334255) (External Info)

Product Area selected: Service and Support Infrastructure Component selected (Preselected/Draft): CA-UI5-FE --- Description --- I am using SAP Businees Application Studio. In this I created the application using SAP FIORI element List Report Template. My application loads fine and also from list page to object page navigation is also fine. Issue:On Object Page I need to  add a custom action button on one table. I placed the custom action button using "SAP Fiori Tool: Open Guided Development". But the action button is not visible on the screen. Attached is the manifest file, index.html file. Please Note: The only difference this app has the odata version which is V4. My all previous working application has Odata V2.
2021-03-09 10:41:20 -  (I053631) (External Info)
Hi , onBeforeRebindTable or it's equivalent is not available in v4 so you cannot achieve this right now. I will check internally when this will be part of our backlog. Kind regards  2021-03-09 10:38:35 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi Nicoas, yes you are right- I need to filter my table in a object page using a custom action. I can pass the filter in OnBeforeRebindTable method which will do the filtering and once I call the rebindtable method of my table it will refresh the table. So the approach which you mentioned i.e. refresh is not useful for me. So request you to please let me know if this can be achieved now or I need to wait for some time Regards,  2021-03-08 08:57:18 -  (I053631) (External Info)
Hello , The ExtensionAPI is actually the `this` object that you can access when defining your action handler. So within the `CustomActions.message` method that you defined you can just call `this.refresh` at this point in time to refresh the table. Please let us know if that helps you solve your issue. -- I'm not sure this will completely fit what you want to do, if I get this right you want to be able to change the filters for a table in an ObjectPage using a custom action and refresh it right ? If that's the case then we do not have any safe API to do this right now, but we can for sure make sure this is part of our development backlog. Kind regards  2021-03-08 06:16:25 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi , Where do i need to place the code as mentioned in the extension API as  the Object page controller do not get called. Any example would be very helpfull Regards,  2021-03-05 15:34:07 -  (D042547) (External Info)
Hello , The underlying UI control for a table in the v4 service is different from the one that is used in v2. Therefore what you are trying to do cannot work. For the v4 service we have a refresh method that can be used via the extension API - you can find the details here: https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/sdk/#/api/sap.fe.templates.ObjectPage.ExtensionAPI%23methods/refresh. In your specific case, you need to go against the events for the sap.m.Table or the ui.Table - depending on what you are using. Hope this helps. Best regards,  2021-03-05 06:25:06 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi , I was able to place a custom action on my table toolbar in Object page following this SAP document(https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/sdk/#/topic/7619517a92414e27b71f02094bd08d06). The custom button handler is placed in a custom javascript and on click of the action button this handler is getting called. Issue: I need to pass some filter on my table( on which the custom action is present) on click of the custom Action. To make it work in my custom Action Handler method, I am calling the smartTable.rebindTable() .This should further call my OnBeforeRebindTable() method which has the logic for the filters .But onBeforeRebindTable() is not getting called. is this because the Extensions is not applicable for V4?Please suggest what needs to be done here. Attached is the manifest file and custom javascript file which has the handler method for the Custom Action button Regards,  2021-03-04 19:39:59 -  (I858534) (External Info)
Hi , The Guided Development team is currently in the process of updating our guides to function for both OData V2 and OData V4 scenarios. At this time, the Add a Custom Action to a Page Using Extensions is only applicable to V2 services. As this update is currently in our backlog, we’d like to ask if you would be comfortable marking this incident as being on-hold so that it can continue to be tracked until we release the V4 version of the guide. Please let us know if that is okay with you. Kind regards,  Product Owner, SAP Fiori tools Guided Development 2021-03-04 15:18:36 -  (D035602) (Internal Info)

Hi, Sorry you are experiencing issues with our tooling, I've managed to re-create your issue using the basic multitarget generator flow. An internal github ticket has been created and I will investigate to find the root cause. In the meantime, I would suggest another flow to create a Fiori Elements application for deployment; Step1. Open the command palette `View` -> `Find Command` a. Enter `Open CF Application Router Generator `, entering a unique Id for `Enter MTA ID` that is unique within your organisation, select ` ` or `Standalone` for `Add router module` I would also suggest you look at the  flow as alternative to standalone, unless you have a specific reason for choosing standalone. Understanding  https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/appstudio-sapui5-create.html#5a114a0f-2e97-40cb-ba1c-8710e713a011 and https://blogs.sap.com/2020/10/02/serverless-sap-fiori-apps-in-sap-cloud-platform/ Please respond with any further questions.  2021-04-08 06:12:01 -  (I336151) (Internal Info)

Solution provided: dear ,

Thats great to hear. I am now closing this incident then and copy/pasting my earlier response as resolution notes.
Good luck with your project.
Best Regards,

------------------
Hi ,
Thanks for your patience on this. So, we investigated your issue and consulted with colleagues from component “CA-UI5-ABA-SAR”.
Based on your use case, they suggested that the warning which you have noticed should not be ignored, it rather signifies a wrong deployment. The problem is that the build of ui5 library produces a nested folder structure but this must not be deployed this way. Only the content of the subfolder must be deployed.

With that in mind, we have a proposal for you which will help you deploy your UI5 library without any warnings.
In your project, please do the following changes:
Update package.json to use the latest @sap/ux-ui5-tooling https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sap/ux-ui5-tooling In your ui5-deploy.yaml file, include ui5-task-flatten-library and update configuration as in https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-task-flatten-library
So it should be something like this:
builder:
customTasks:
- name: ui5-task-flatten-library
afterTask: generateResourcesJson

3. Run the following command:
npm install
npm run build
npm run deploy
After running npm run build, you should see the dist folder contain flattened file structure. E.g. library.js directly under dist/library.js.

At this point, you should not see the warning you were seeing earlier. Please validate and let me know before I close this incident.

Please note that SAP Fiori tools still does not support creation/maintenance/deployment of SAP UI5 library (it in our roadmap but as you would understand I cannot commit on an ETA). Having said that we want you to move forward and I am hoping this alternate way helps you at this point.

Best Regards,
 2022-04-28 07:20:34 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)

 2022-04-14 08:04:15 -  (I508774) (Internal Info)
Hello ,

this warning should not be ignored because it indicates a wrong deployment.
The problem is that the build of ui5 library produces a nested folder structure but this must not be deployed this way. Only the content of the subfolder must be deployed.
In WebIDE the template of an ui5 library project added a special build task to flatten the output before the deployment https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-task-flatten-library.
However, it would be better if the deploy task would understand to only deploy the subfolder content then the flattening is not needed.

Dear CA-UI5-ABA-SAR colleagues,
This is  from SAP Fiori tools and would need your input in handling this customer's issue.
Background: SAP Fiori tools as of today does not support custom UI5 library. Customer went ahead and used it to deploy. While officially we do not support it yet, but we will not mind making it an exception for deployment scenario. Now, before we do that, as this customer issue points out, there is a warning from backend about "missing manifest file". We would like to know whether from backend is this something that might change in future? Or we can just ignore this warning? As far as we can see/test, the project gets deployed.
So wondering if you can help or provide your inputs here? Happy to have a discussion with you if needed.

Best Regards,
 2022-04-08 22:15:02 -  (I829208) (External Info)
Hello ,
We are nearing the end of our investigation from SAP Fiori tools side. Please expect that by Monday/Tuesday next week I will have information for you.
Also, its very likely that I will run your scenario by our backend colleagues to get their take on this too.

Thanks much.

assigning to you  as per our conversation in sync. 2022-03-21 07:06:39 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)... the deployment log also says that it can upload libraries. So I'm little confused:
Upload of SAPUI5 App or Library from ZIP-Archive into SAPUI5 ABAP Repository 2022-03-21 07:03:26 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hello , are there any limitations if we use it already?

For me it looks like it works as intended. The library gets registered, and UI5 apps can find and use them at runtime. Thanks, and Best regards  2022-03-18 20:23:36 -  (I802475) (External Info)
Dear customer,
Thanks for reaching out to us. I am very sorry to inform you that the creation and deployment of the custom UI5 library is not yet supported in SAP Fiori tools. We have them in our backlog and will try prioritize so we can deliver these features sooner.
In meantime, the manual steps are described in: https://ui5.sap.com/#/topic/a883327a82ef4cc792f3c1e7b7a48de8

Thank you for the information.  I've configured the destinations to be of Proxy type Internet and they are working.  However, we would really like these destinations to go through the cloud connector.  When configuring the destinations with the same parameters but with different proxies and URLs to go to the cloud connector, we are getting errors. Is there documentation or additional configuration needed in order to utilize a cloud connector? Thanks, 2022-11-29 11:04:53 -  (I012956) (External Info)
Dear customer,

Thanks for contacting SAP Support and providing detailed information regarding your issue. On review, I can see some configuration issues that are likely causing the issue when trying to retrieve services from the DO5_Full destination. This destination is configured as a full_url endpoint, but it only contains a partial url (only the host). If the requirement is to use this as a full_url destination, please update the destination configuration url to point to the full odata service url. Also in this case the 'WebIDEUsage' properties only need to contain 'odata_gen', and should not contain 'odata_abap' as this would indicate a catalog service.
We have some additional help documents on this configuration in SAP Guided Answers, you mention checking tutorials so I'm unsure if you have seen these. Guided answers can help with various issues in Fiori tools, here are some deep links from this tool that should help with this issue:
Full/Partial url configuration issues:

Solution provided: Hi ,
Thanks for the feedback.  I agree that there were lots of issues you have encountered :(, and sorry for that.  Some related to our tooling and others I think related to the hardening of your system.  We do have a comprehensive guide for Fiori tools, which is detailed in our help portal at: https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_FIORI_tools?locale=en-US.

The assumption when using Fiori tools is that the services you want to consume are already correctly configured.  Your feedback is of course relevant, and we will look to link the documentation from our backend colleagues so that we can provide a more complete guide.

Please also be aware that we are continually updating the "Guided Answers" tool with questions and answers to help customers diagnose issues like this and provide relevant support.  "Guided Answers" is a recent addition to our tooling and will grow with more documentation as we encounter scenarios like this with our customers.

As your original issues are now fixed, I will mark this issue as resolved.  But we will take your feedback to improve our documentation.

Regards,

Hi , The Guided Answer is a little bit misleading but was somehow helpful.  It led us to OSS note 2999557. The "steps to reproduce" was the helpful part, and solved the problem.  The solution, of course was not any helpful. Not without a surprise, after solving this problem, a new problem popped out: ERR! builder:custom deploy-to-abap Request failed with status code 400 ERR! builder:custom deploy-to-abap No default virus profile active or found. Please check the offical guide.

This certainly feels like peeling onion - one after the next.  I am wondering is there anywhere a proper documentation on the step by step guide that shows the prerequisites and the steps that are required?  The suppose the application generator is meant to achieve that in one way or the other, but I believe it needs to be supplemented by a guide to be successful.

Hello ,

You could potentially look at using cross-env npm library, see https://www.npmjs.com/package/cross-env for details.  But it allows you to pass environment variables as parameters to npm scripts.

If you add it your project (npm i --save-dev cross-env), and then update the 'deploy' npm script in the package.json to pass in the variables as needed.   So, e.g.:

"scripts": {
"deploy": "cross-env NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=xxx .... }

Hello , Please correct me if I am wrong, but we are not using  (anymore) right, at least not recommended anymore, and it does not come now on vanilla installations? For that reason, I believe only #2 is applicable: Once the certificate file is downloaded, the issue can be resolved for VS Code by importing it into your global certificate store. To do so, . . . I suppose when it says global certificate store, it is referring to certmgr.msc, right?  If that's the case, then yes, it is already done, and is actually automatically done since the computer is an organization-managed computer, so the organizational root certificate is already trusted.  This is one of the requirements for internal sites secured by the private CA  to work.

Hello ,
could you please try the following to resolve the issue: https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_FIORI_tools/17d50220bcd848aa854c9c182d65b699/4b318bede7eb4021a8be385c46c74045.html?locale=en-US?
If I am not mistaken one also needs to add the certificate to Node.js.

I am trying to deploy the  to the on-premise system, and I am getting the error below (as seen in the attachment). info builder:custom deploy-to-abap Starting Deployment. WARN builder:custom deploy-to-abap Connecting without any credentials, deployment may fail if authorization is required ERR! builder:custom deploy-to-abap Deployment Failed. ERR! builder:custom deploy-to-abap unable to get local issuer certificate The system uses a private CA, so I wonder if VS Code does not use the Windows Certificate Store to verify trusted certificates?  Does it have a separate store of itself indicating which issuers it trusts? May I kindly ask for some hints to overcome this problem, please. Thank you!  2022-08-11 09:36:12 -  (D062812) (External Info)
Hello ,
you can ignore this error. The error comes from the fact, and please correct me if I am wrong, that when the project was generated there was no OData service selected. If you check the "ui5.yaml" of your application then for the "fiori-tools-proxy" you should see the following:

backend:
- path: /sap
url: http://localhost

This is just a placeholder definition. If you comment out this part, then the error will disappear. Also please have a look at the configuration examples at https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sap/ux-ui5-tooling#2-proxy. This will help you define you backend connection once you needed.

Hope this helps!

Hello , Thanks a lot for that recommendation.  I tried it, and it worked almost perfectly. It now starts the local web server at port 8080 and the application is loaded successfully. There is one little problem though.  It seems that connection is happening on port 80 instead of 8080 and is failing. I temporarily disabled my local firewall to rule out the issue, but it did not help since the web server is really listening on 8080 and not 80. Kindly check the attachment I provided. Thank you!  2022-08-10 11:17:56 -  (D062812) (External Info)
Solution provided: Dear customer,
the configuration that you have in the launch.json is not entirely correct. It just opens the Edge browser, but it doesn't starts the local server on "localhost:8080".
Could you please try with the attached launch.json? This will start the local server and it will open the application in your default browser.
Best regards,

The Fiori tools team

Dear customer,
thank you for our call yesterday, it helped me to understand the issue that you are facing. As you mentioned in the call you don't want to use any OData, but to call APIs directly from your application. In this case you don't need the "dataSources" configuration in the "manifest.json", you can completely delete it. Also in the "manifest.json" there is a section called "models". Inside of this section there is a model definition "", please remove it. Deleting the "dataSources" and the model "" will resolve the 502 Bad Gateway issue.

I was also able to preview the application with the modified View. To see the modified View one needs to update the "manifest.json". In the "manifest.json" there is a property called "rootView", there we need to set that e.g. the "View1.xml" is our rootView. When a SAPUI5 application is generated, it is generated by default with 2 views: "App.view.xml" and "View1.view.xml, and by default the "App.view.xml" is set as rootView. But in our call we did all the changes in the "View1.view.xml" and that is why we were not able to see our changes.

Additionally, when previewing the application locally in order to connect to the BAS destinations, you will need to update the "ui5.yaml" of your application as described in https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sap/ux-ui5-tooling#connecting-to-a-back-end-system-with-destination. You need one entry for each destination that you want to use in your application.

Please check the "test_updated.tar", I updated "project2" as described above.
Please also check this Tutorials, I believe they are useful for understanding the application development in BAS.

Hi,
Thank you joining the call today;
Here is the summary;
1. Issue with memory resolved - root cause was down to quotas not being applied in the respective subaccounts and the deployed apps not being configured to restrict memory usage.
2. Unable to deploy app to CF due to `maximum file length exceeded` exception being thrown. This is related to the configuration and layout of their mta.yaml. In their mta.yaml,  the module `actpay_odata_ui_deployer` is referencing a path of `.` which means everything in the project folder is being dumped into the repo host respository which is over 100mb in size. This rep host setting is normally used to store HTML5 static content so this needs to be addressed. I've suggested using one of the tutorials mentioned below to address this issue;
Please refer to the following blog for more details;
https://blogs.sap.com/2020/12/15/deploying-a-cap-based-fiori-app-to-a-central-launchpad/
3. It was suggested that the developers move to a managed  approach to expose their UI with CAP project backend. This would provide a more reliable approach as their current memory quotas on their company subaccounts are currently limited to 1gb memory.
This tutorial will guide them through what they need and will allow them to migrate their existing SAPUI5 into the new project structure once completed.
https://developers.sap.com/group.dsag-cloud-dev-day-cf.html
There is currently no issue with the Fiori tooling and issues are currently related to how their apps are configured and managed.

Hi , PFA of CAP project from trail account. Regarding steps followed:
Login to your CF - cf login right-click on project explorer window -> import project choose the project zip file (from attachment) Once import done, right-click on mta.yaml file and chose build MTA project Deploy mta_archives file.
Note: Before deploying, make sure that your hana cloud instance is running. I followed all the above steps, and got those memory exist error in trail account as well.

regards,
 2021-10-13 10:34:43 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
Can you please export the latest project from your trial account;
zip -r feproject.zip ./ / -x */\.* *.git* \.* *.zip *.csv *.rb *.env *.bak *.swp *.back *.merge *.txt *.sh **/mta-op-*/**\* **/node_modules/**\* **/mta_archives/**\* **/dist/**.*
And attach it to the ticket.
If you are able to reproduce the same issue on trial then please document the exact steps and I should be able reproduce them?
We can connect on teams, my email is *EMAIL*.
Thanks.

2021-10-13 09:57:24 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi , Have attached the version you asked for (PFA). It was the same version that you have mentioned as the latest correct version. Actually, the one which I shared latest is from a new dev space using the Full Stack option. (for this Incident, we did so). Clarifications:
For me, it is producing a ~205mb mta archive. I tried in my trial account as well which has hanatrial only. There also the same issue. I suggest you, check your point - 3 again. For me, the same memory issue came both in the trial account as well as the production account. So, to me, it is not just related breach limits on the account. Please correct me, if I am wrong. Deploying the application is creating an error (as you can check in the previous attachment - BTP_applications_overview.png ). In that attachment file, actpay_odata-srv is the SRV module and app is  module that has UI5 project. Note: actpay_odata-db-deployer is the DB module and it got deployed properly - disk quota is 1024mb and memory used is 256mb. node_module is present in ui module inside build mtar file (which we are deploying to CF) as you can see in the attachment - nodeModules_inside_ui_module_mtar_file.png
As I have already stated, we need to sought-out this ASAP. I am okay with connecting directly through MS team. If that helps in finding the root cause for this issue.  2021-10-13 08:41:08 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
Can you please confirm the following, open a new terminal and run the following steps and attach the output to this ticket please;
npm -v
node -v
mbt -v
mta -v
Just to confirm, I've taken your latest CAP zip project, installed it both on BAS and mac and there is no issue with generation of the mta archive. On both occasiosns it produces a 108mb file.
Steps taken on both BAS and ;
change file actpay_cap.tar to actpay_cap.zip
unzip actpay_cap.zip
npm i
cds build
right click mta.yaml and build archive
In both cases, a 108mb file was produced.
Would it be possible for you to create a new dev space using the Full Stack option and follow the same steps?
Some clarifications;
1. The latest zip you provided, produces a 108mb mta archive on both BAS and Mac
2. Changing to hanatrial will not make any difference to the generation of the mta archive
3. I was able to reproduce a memory issue by generating a number of other test apps so I could breach my limits on the account for testing purposes, this was NOT caused by your application
4. Deploying your application was not an issue, except with the db-deployer which I'm going to resolve but the applications were still deployed correctly
5. Yes your configuration is ignoring "node_modules/" but in some cases there are other folders generated i.e. tmp folders which could be an issue. Please remove any tmp folders, in some cases these start with a dot.

2021-10-13 08:01:50 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi , Regarding that db-deployer failure, you can comment out that part in the file "src/gen/CatalogService.V_PO_Item.hdbview" (34:6-13) which causes that particular error. Our main concern is to deploy the project successfully. And since you are using a trial account, you have to change it to hanatrial. So that won't be a solution. Please clarify this, When you try to build mta.yaml file, it is producing an archive of 108mb. So, if you deploy the same, it should not give "memory space_quota_exceeded" error, correct? This is the same issue, I am also facing. (already mentioned in the below communication) Note: It is a small project, so ideally we should be able to deploy in the trial account as well. If we are getting error means, we need to add some configuration either in the project config file (i.e., mta.yaml) or the issue may be with the product itself (BAS). It can be either one scenario. The versions of (npm and node) which you are asking us to check, will it solve the issue? If so, have you been able to resolve the above issue "CF-UnprocessableEntity(10008): memory space_quota_exceeded, memory quota_exceeded"? Note: We haven't specifically set any node engine config in package.json. So it will use the default version which BAS has configured. Issues which I found with BAS: While building the mta_archive file, BAS should ignore the already existing mta_archive folder and node_module folder. This increases the build file size drastically. Please check with any other technical person in SAP. We couldn't able to seek this out on our own, that's why we are asking for your assistance. We need to migrate all our projects from neo to CF within a couple of months. I hope, you guys will come up with a solution ASAP. Thanks,  2021-10-12 13:49:12 -  (I313149) (External Info)

Hi,
Sorry for the late response, I've been trying to re-create your scenario on my trial account.
I've managed to build and deploy your mta.yaml which produces an archive of 108mb in size. The only change is to the `actpay_odata-db` resource where the service was changed from hana to hanatrial.
The applications were deployed correctly but the db-deployer step is failing due to an issue with the Catalogue;
Error: The file requires "db://PO_ITEM" which is not provided by any file [8212001] at "src/gen/CatalogService.V_PO_Item.hdbview" (34:6-13) Error: The file requires "db://PO_ITEM" which is not provided by any file [8212001]
If you can provide the steps to resolve this, please let me know and I can redeploy the app.
I've also managed to produce a similar issue;
Error starting application "actpay_odata-srv": Controller operation failed: 422 Unprocessable Entity: CF-UnprocessableEntity(10008): memory space_quota_exceeded, memory quota_exceeded
Where I've managed to breach the space quotas that are configured on my account but I've only limited access to be abe to set the account quotas at organisation level so I dont think I can reproduce your exact exception.
Can you confirm the following, open a new terminal and run the following steps;
npm -v
// Correct version 6.14.15
node -v // Correct version v14.17.6 mbt -v // Correct version Cloud MTA Build Tool version 1.2.3 mta -v // Correct version MTA version v1.0.1
You can also reference any tutorials you have used? The reason I've suggested https://developers.sap.com/group.dsag-cloud-dev-day-cf.html is to understand how the managed approurter approach is a better way to manage the UI5 applications rathar than using a standalone . Is this something you've considered?
If you've made any more changes to your sample app, please attach it to the support ticket for me to validate;
zip -r feproject.zip ./ / -x */\.* *.git* \.* *.zip *.csv *.rb *.env *.bak *.swp *.back *.merge *.txt *.sh **/mta-op-*/**\* **/node_modules/**\* **/mta_archives/**\* **/dist/**.*
Ensure this command is run a level higher than the CAP project.

Hi , I think you are not understanding our issue. I have attached a screenshot from which you will get to know, that the error is not related to BTP account configuration. It must be caused because of some configuration that is required in mta.yaml file in our application. Please refer to the attachment (cap_application_vs_html_application_BTP.png): Highlighted with yellow color denotes HTML5 application (same UI5 project which is included inside CAP project's  as UI component) Highlighted with orange color denotes  instance of CAP application. Please check that, here memory and Disk quota occupied by both instances are different. Even though, contents of both the application are same. You have mentioned that you are unable to reproduce the issue. Is this means, you are not getting any error while deploying capProject_new.zip project (which I have already attached on 04.10.2021 at 09:11)? If you are not getting any errors, please guide us on which steps/configurations were missed. Thanks and regards,  2021-10-08 13:57:39 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
I've tried to reproduce the issue with a test account and Im unable to so Im going to try on a trial account now.
Please refer to the following thread which gives some informaiton on addressing quota issues in your space.
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54941611/publishing-app-to-cloud-foundry-errors-exceeded-organizations-memory-limit-ho
Based on the error messages in your logs, there seems to be a quota misconfiguration in one of your spaces.

A futher update to determine if its a space issue;
You can also see the summary of your organisation;
cf org --guid

will output your organization id. You can get the name of your organisation by running `cf orgs`, please select the one you are deploying the application to.
cf curl /v2/organizations/ /summary

will return json object with spaces and total memory they are consuming. Please look at mem_dev_total property which will indicate how much you are using.

Hi ,
I had attached the wrong project. The one I had attached is just an MTA project without UI5 module, that's why it gave a small file. Sorry for the inconvenience.
Now, I have attached the correct file(PFA - named "capProject_new.zip"). Can you please check that? In this project, under the app folder, I have used the SAPUI5 freestyle module (created by right-click on mta.yaml file and chose "create MTA module from Template"). While deploying, I get an error as "CF-UnprocessableEntity(10008): memory_in_mb exceeds organization memory quota"I have checked in BTP - subaccount (PFA - named ''BTP_applications_overview.png'), both srv and  occupy a complete 1024MB disk space.

Dear customer,
The attached project generates a big mtar as the build packages also the node_modules folders. If you configure all relevant module to ignore packing of node_modules folders then the mtar will be smaller and it will be possible to deploy it. Please refer to 'Configuring module build artifacts to package into MTA archive'.

Hi colleagues,
This customer is using BAS to generate an mtar, and it's getting generated with 1.4GB.
The customer would have to purchase more memory for their subaccount in order to deploy this, but they are asking if it's normal for such a large file to be generated from BAS. The project is created using a generator only, so only the configuration is automatically generated. It has a configuration in mta.yaml as follows: build-parameters: ignore: ["default-env.json", "node_modules/", "package-lock.json"]
I could not find documentation or cases with similar questions. The previous team mentioned KBA 3012674, but it does no answer the customer's query.
Could you assist with this? They have attached the project, along with screenshots.

Dear Colleagues,
I think this is better served by your component. We just handle issues with the tool itself, I wouldn’t be able to answer on file sizes or memory.
So the customer is creating a project in BAS, and it is generating a build file that is 1.4GB, which will not deploy as they exceed their memory in BTP. I initially found a KBA, https://i7p.wdf.sap.corp/sap/support/notes/2659925, which says they have to purchase more memory.
The customer has responded and asked if it is normal that a build file would be this size. I am not sure form my side, but I found a KBA from your area which talks a bit about this, but doesn’t go into file size standards. The KBA I found is https://i7p.wdf.sap.corp/sap/support/notes/3012674. I haven’t sent this to customer yet, so keeping it as an internal link.
Can you check from your side?
Kind regards,  2021-10-01 13:52:48 -  (I328000) (External Info)
Hi ,
I will get the CA-BAS-FS team to clarify these concerns for you. From my side we support the tool itself and I found the KBA from searching. I will get that team to follow up with you, they will be in contact shortly

Hi ,
One quick question, Is it normal, that BAS generates a 1.4 GB build file (which is going to be deployed in BTP CF)? Note: The solution given is more related to configuration in BTP and it seems we have already taken care of those (PFA). Because we have other non-CAP projects (HTML5 application) working fine. And I assume, those also use Cloud Foundry runtime. Can you please look into the above issue and reclarify my doubts? Thanks and regards,  2021-10-01 13:09:43 -  (I328000) (External Info)

Hello SAP Team, We tried deploying the application from BAS. But still we are unable to do so. During the deployment activity we are getting error with the credentials. Also, after manually updating the credentials in the ui5-deploy-yaml file the error still comes. I have attached the deployment error log for your reference. Please help to resolve this issue at the earliest ! Thanks 2022-11-01 11:17:05 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
Yes, there was a  outage last week which impacted applications dependent on destinations to provide the data source for their applications or during deployment execution.. This has now been resolved and your issue should be no longer be occuring. In your specific case, the initial GET request to identify if the ABAP application was already deployed was failing due to this outage thus our Fiori Tooling tried to re-create the app again instead of updating it. Please re-run your deployment steps as normal to ensure this is working as expected.

Sorry for the inconvenience and best of luck with your project.

Hello Team, Any update on the issue? We do not want to use workaround. The BAS issue might be  and affects all customers? When can we expect the issue to be resolved? Thanks 2022-10-20 11:30:43 -  (I305274) (External Info)
Hi customer,

Can you please try the following workaround whilst we are identifying a fix?  You can do one of 2 things:

There are a couple of workarounds you can do in the meantime:

1. You can undeploy and then re-deploy your application by doing the following:

In the root of your Fiori project, execute: npm run undeploy
This should undeploy the existing application.  You can then run:
npm run deploy

to deploy it again.

2. Otherwise, you can use /UI5/UI5_REPOSITORY_LOAD to directly upload your application.

Hopefully that works for you. 2022-10-20 11:14:54 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Please let us know when the fix is ready. 2022-10-18 16:07:21 -  (I305274) (External Info)
Hello customer,

Sorry that you having this issue with re-deploying your app.  I'm from the SAP Fiori tools team, and please be aware that we have identified this as an issue and are working on an update.

In the meantime, I hope the workaround is available to you, I will update this issue when the fix has been implemented and released.

Best regards,

Dear customer,
Based on this note, it seems your ABAP version is below the version that supports ATO settings query. https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2283716 Could you check with your basis team if they can help with upgrade the system if you do need this input validation feature?
From the Fiori tools side, I will report this to our product owners and see if we can detect ATO settings query is missing and show a warning message instead of error message in this case.
Please do let us know if there is anything else we can support you.

Dear customer,
Please find the summary of our call today.
Findings:
- Customer can deploy to the backend system without problem. The only issue is the ATO setting request during deploy config. The ATO setting response is only used for validating/defaulting user input such as transport number and package name during deploy config. It is not blocking the deploy config generation.
- ATO setting requests caused 404 Service Not Exist error. We tested with querying the ADT discovery service, the response is attached in discovery.xml file. The discovery.xml contains all the available ADT rest services. The following ATO service, which exists on our internal test systems, cannot be found in the discovery.xml from customer system.  This could be the root cause of the problem. But I don't have enough ABAP backend knowledge to further investigate this.

- Customer has ABAP verison details attached in the ABAPSystemVersion.png. Next step: - Customer will involve basis experts to investigate why this particular ADT service "/sap/bc/adt/ato/settings" is missing. -  will check which SAP support team could help with this issue. Best regards,

Hi, the guide we followed for project creation and deploy configuration is the following: https://blogs.sap.com/2020/10/29/develop-deploy-sapui5-fiori-like-app-using-sap-business-application-studio-bas-and-troubleshooting/ Connection via SD9_HTTP and SD9_HTTPS (we tried both and both were successful) is working. The file SD9_data from the attachment shows some data that we retrieved from SD9. Deploying works, we only get a note regarding deprecated, that's why we use the npm script "deploy-config". Best regards  2022-05-10 23:43:17 -  (I830561) (External Info)
Dear customer,
The cloud connector configuration looks good to me. "while using the Business Application Studio (BAS) we use the deploy config script in a fresh project and get the error message form the attachment. we followed the guide from https://blogs.sap.com/2020/10/03/working-with-github-in-sap-business-application-studio-next-generation-of-sap-web-ide/ - these steps seem to be done correctly, but the BTP service fails to recive the data from the SD9 backend system." I want to have a look at the steps you have done. But the guide your mentioned above is for github integration. I am not sure which guide you followed for project creation and deploy configuration. If you can find the direct link to the Fiori project creation and deploy guide, could you send it to me? I am asking because I want to know if you were able to successfully connect to SD9_HTTPS destination before? E.g. If you had created a Fiori Element project and successfully connect to SD9_HTTPS? If it is ok for you, could you also provide a zip of your Fiori project configuration? You don't need to include the node_modules folder to keep the zip file size small. Best regards,  2022-05-10 16:36:21 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi, thank you for your answer. Unfortunately the link doesn't work for us. I added three pictures to the attachment. CC1 shows the CC settings, CC2 shows the CC paths and BTP shows the BTP destination settings. Cloud Connector and BTP connection checks are both green. The SAP_CC user has the same permissions as he has in other systems, so that shouldn't be the problem. Best regards,  2022-05-09 18:11:12 -  (I830561) (External Info)
Dear customer,
Thanks for your testing. The XML response you posted indicates your user doesn't have authorization to this service. The service is activated on your on-prem system. The deploy tooled tried to query this ATO service from sap cloud platform but received a different 404 error. It seems to indicate your cloud configuration is not correctly configured. We should look into this first and then deal with the authorization issue.
The link my colleague  posted have some suggestions for the cloud connector settings. Please check if it helps you.
https://answers.sap.com/questions/493025/error-access-denied-to-resource-sapbcadtdiscovery-.html
It would also help if you can attach screenshots of your cloud connector settings. So we can check if there is any incorrect configuration.

Best regards,
 2022-05-09 16:22:40 -  (I313149) (External Info)

Hi, I got the following XML response returned: http://www.sap.com/abapxml/types/communicationframework"> Keine Berechtigung zum Zugriff auf die Ressource /sap/bc/adt/ato/settings Keine Berechtigung zum Zugriff auf die Ressource /sap/bc/adt/ato/settings It looks like access to /sap/bc/adt/ato/settings is denied. I checked /sap/bc/adt via SICF and it's active. Also the corresponding path is enabled in the cloud connector. Best regards  2022-05-06 17:09:40 -  (I830561) (External Info)
Dear customer,
It seems the deploy config generator is not able to fetch transport config settings. Are you able to directly query your on-premise system within your corp network? If you can, could you help to run the following test to help identifying the root cause is either on-premise system or the cloud connectivity settings. Test steps: Depending on your server is http or https, please use the appropriate url: http:// : /sap/bc/adt/ato/settings?sap-client=100 https:// : /sap/bc/adt/ato/settings?sap-client=100 You only need to put the url in a browser window on a computer that have access to your on-premise system. If the query is successful, an XML response is returned. The xml content might be shown in the browser page, or it might be a file called "settings" downloaded by your browser.

Hi,
the requested JSON file is attached and was retrieved via BAS. After consulting the IT admin, no firewalls or proxies are blocking.  2022-05-05 09:23:46 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
To further diaganose the issue, can you please attach the destination properties for SD9_HTTPS, you can run this command and pull out the properties for it;
Open a new terminal window and run;
curl $H2O_URL/api/listDestinations > dest.json >&1
Please note, this command is only available on Business Application Studio (BAS) as the $H20 proxy is only available on this system.
If not running on BAS, please confirm how you are running our Fiori Tools? Another option to retrieve the destination properties is to login to your SAP BTP cockpit, select your subaccount, select destinations and export the SD9_HTTPS destination and attach the file to the support ticket.
You might need to contact your IT admin to ensure you can correctly connect to the endpoint exposed in the URL property of your destination. Ensure there are no proxy or firewalls blocking you.

Hi ,

Thank you for the update. Since the ticket was raised for an issue with importing an app from ABAP to BAS, and some issues with local preview were mentioned as well, let me clarify following:
you have successfully imported the app to BAS according the steps I provided you with earlier you have successfully migrated the app based you have successfully verified the migrated app as described as the last step of the migration you did (maybe) some changes of the app you want now to deploy the app into an ABAP and facing the error mentioned in the provided issue BAS deploy issue log.txt, right?
From the log it looks like the deployment was cancelled due to missing a transport request, see the message "Creating new SAPUI5 ABAP repository ZMM_OT_PAYMENTS - Task/request FD0K901384 does not exist in system ZAD". Can you check this?
If there'll be further issues, kindly follow this Guided Answers which may help you to solve it as well. In case some problems will persist, please do following:
run command Fiori: Open Environment Check (allows you to check the destination) attach the results as zip to the ticket archive the project to zip (excluding node_modules) to attach it to the ticket as I described earlier
Thank you for your co-operation.

Hi , Thanks for below suggestions. We have gone through the migration process and we followed the same. We trigerred Start Migration from the pop-up window appeared but the project that we want to migrate(from the list of projects by checking the corresponding checkbox) is not showing in the list. So as recommended in the process we checked the target system-> it is defined with Web id in BTP Destinations (Reference Screenshot has attached). Please suggest, Do we need to maintain BAS Destinations in BTP also? Thanks & Regards,  2022-11-08 14:42:08 -  (D040068) (External Info)
Dear ,

Kindly note that SAP Fiori tools provide a migration utility to help move your SAP Fiori projects from other services, such as SAP WebIDE - kindly check the Migration process. You can also manually import an existing SAP Fiori application from the SAPUI5 ABAP repository to SAP Business Application Studio as described in Importing an Application steps. I hope this helps you further.

The Fiori tools team 2022-11-08 14:07:39 -  (I022947) (Internal Info)

,

Thank you for highlighting this. From initial investigation, it looks related to a version of the sap/cds library which is consumed by the Fiori generator which is taking in these older libraries.  We will look to update the version of CDS which will hopefully upgrade this.

We have a bug created to resolve this.

Dear customer,
Guided Development supports the development or enhancement of SAP Fiori apps in design time with source codes for the app.
The reason you are not seeing the adaptation project in the project picker in Guided Development is that Adaptation Project is an extension of an existing SAP Fiori project and the original source code is not part of the adaptation project.  To make changes to an adaptation project, please use SAPUI5 Visual Editor as suggested by the SAP colleagues in the previous comment.
I hope this answers your question and enable you to carry on with UAT. If not, please let me know the best time and phone number to call.
Best regards,

Dear Customer,
For other type of projects a different teams are responsible. I will forward the incident to another component now, although I'm not sure who is responsible for the Guided Development.
I hope the colleagues in that team will know and can redirect you to the correct place.
Otherwise if you use Adaptation project follow the documentation from my previous answer and don't use the Guided Development for it.

 2022-07-15 06:33:44 -  (I310817) (External Info)
Dear Customer,

From the provided screenshots I can see that you are creating Adaptation project. Adaptation project is not related in any way with the Guided Development.
Once you have created the Adaptation project you have to open webapp folder and right click on manifest.appdescr_variant file and select SAPUI5 Visual Editor.
SAPUI5 Visual Editor is is a design-time editor that provides an intuitive user interface to modify SAPUI5 Adaptation Project applications. For example, you can add, remove, or move fields and groups. You can also view all properties of the controls in the application and change the configurable properties.
Here is the official documentation: https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP%20Business%20Application%20Studio/584e0bcbfd4a4aff91c815cefa0bce2d/9d2028f106d44424a0f4637541b6e25f.html
This one is for the adapting the created project: https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP%20Business%20Application%20Studio/584e0bcbfd4a4aff91c815cefa0bce2d/2644b855e6324afb8d9c029e3cc0d897.html
You can also check these blog posts: https://blogs.sap.com/2022/01/26/sap-fiori-elements-adaptation-project-adding-a-custom-filter-to-the-list-report/
Parts of this one is related to Adaptation project in Web IDE, but the part with usage of Visual Editor is the same as in BAS: https://blogs.sap.com/2019/12/16/adaptation-project-get-to-know-how-to-extend-a-fiori-elements-app/
So please check the provided documentation and if you have further questions we can have a meeting. I'm located in Bulgaria and my email is *EMAIL*

Hello CA-UI5-FL-ADP-BAS colleagues,
Please take it over this case back. I've discussed with product lead of ATP about this issue. We think that this is an issue with the webapp rather than with our BOP Monitor APP... Maybe there is a restriction and the APP can not be enhanced or used in an adaptation project. You have to clarify – why “No values are coming in Select Project Dropdown”?!
Thanks and best regards,  SAP Support 2022-07-13 15:35:52 -  (I523074) (External Info)

Hi,
Thanks for joining the call today.
Here is a summary of the call;
1. Reviewed two apps, first app was generated using a Freestyle template, the webapp contents from the Neo app were then copied over. This solution didnt work and instead it was suggest to migrate the Neo app using the FIori tools migrator tool.
2. After migrating using the migrator tool, local preview is blocked from loading the application since a number of the destinations require SSO which is not configured yet on the SAP BTP account destinations.
3. Blogs/Help guides to be forwarded on around SSO

Hello  , Thank you so much for your quick response , Can we please schedule a call and discuss these things ? Regards,  2022-11-25 12:32:15 -  (I313149) (External Info)

Hi,
So after reviewing your attachments, here is some feedback.
1. Destinations
Based on the environment check zip, you have no destinations exposed at subaccount level. You have a neoHybridapp that is dependent on a number of destinations as shown in the neo-app.json of your application. These need to be created so they can be used when deployed to Cloud Foundry
2. You created an app called com.sap.build.standard.brfappdegraosmodoeditar_ n using a managed approuter configuration
You created a Fiori UI application without any datasource, you can validate this by reviewing the ui5.yaml which has a backend pointing to localhost.
The issue with the mta.yaml is due to the module name `com-sap-build-standard-brfappdegraosmodoeditar`, when you used the Approuter Configuration Generator, there is no validation on the ID but Cloud Foundry has a name limit on certain fields. Please update the following lines so they are using the same name;
Line 25 ServiceInstanceName: com-sap-build-standard-html5-srv
Line 90 to service-name: com-sap-build-standard-html5-srv
Please be aware, this application will not preview when deployed to CF even with these changes made. The reason is, your manifest.json has a number of datasources exposed but there is no destination either created  at subaccount level or as part of your mta.yaml to retreive the OData XML metadata.
I would suggest you take the original Neo migrated app and follow the migration help guide;
https://help.sap.com/docs/HTML5_APPLICATIONS/b98f42a4d2cd40a9a3095e9f0492b465/b1763fd06421457b9970a3555020e750.html
There are a number of manual steps required before you can migrate your neo app and to support deployment to CF.


2022-11-25 10:34:09 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hello , I have attached 3 application here
Neo application source code which we need to migrate Fiori application template which we created in CF and taking content files from neo application Env check files 2022-11-24 14:44:57 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
After reviewing your support ticket, I've a couple of questions for you;
1. Your request is to migrate a HTML5 application from Neo to CF with Fiori support? If so, please follow this help guide to migrate your application using Fiori Tools and to support deploymend to Cloud Foundry, this guide will ensure you are have all the required steps completed;
https://help.sap.com/docs/HTML5_APPLICATIONS/b98f42a4d2cd40a9a3095e9f0492b465/b1763fd06421457b9970a3555020e750.html
2. How was your deployment MTA configuration generated? I would need to review your project and deployment configuration to understand your MTA deployment issue. From SAP Business Application Studio, open command palette via View -> Find Command and enter "Fiori: Open Environment Check" -> Select your specific project. Please attach the generated zip to the support ticket for review.

Hello  , We followed the blog and we changed the mobile services app URL on CF I am attaching the screenshot for those. The main issue is the hybrid application in neo deploys the web module also,  we imported and exported the mobile application in CF but what about web module so for web module we created a Fiori application template and we migrated this web project, when we are trying to deploy this we are getting error I am attaching deployment error also . Please let us know if we can have a call so that we can show you the exact steps which we are following . 2022-11-15 11:13:22 -  (I332971) (External Info)

Web IDE Full-Stack Hybrid Application Toolkit is not available in Cloud Foundry.
the following post is targeting existing Mobile Services NEO users who want to migrate their application to Mobile Services on Cloud Foundry:
How to adapt hybrid apps created with HAT to use Mobile Services on Cloud Foundry | SAP Blogs
For developing new mobile apps in a Cloud Foundry environment, we recommend using MDK.
If you want to continue developing hybrid cordova based apps, you will need to use the Kapsel SDK in combo with Mobile Services on Cloud Foundry.

in BAS, you should be able to choose “Start from Template” and then select the MTA generator as shown on the image that i attached. Let us know if that is helping you. 2021-12-03 10:54:34 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
Here are the required changes;
1. Generate the HTML5 applications as-is
2. Change into the generated HTML5 application folder
3. Edit the package.json as follows;
Before
"scripts": { "build": "npm run clean && ui5 build --include-task=generateManifestBundle generateCachebusterInfo && npm run zip", "zip": "cd dist && npx bestzip ../customer_payment_report_module-content.zip *", "clean": "npx rimraf customer_payment_report_module-content.zip dist"}
After:"scripts": { "build": "npm run clean && ui5 build --include-task=generateManifestBundle generateCachebusterInfo && npm run zip", "zip": "cd dist && ../node_modules/bestzip/bin/cli.js ../customer_payment_report_module-content.zip *", "clean": "node_modules/rimraf/bin.js customer_payment_report_module-content.zip dist"},
The two changes are as follows;"zip": "cd dist && npx bestzip ../customer_payment_report_module-content.zip *"becomes"zip": "cd dist && ../node_modules/bestzip/bin/cli.js ../customer_payment_report_module-content.zip *",
"clean": "npx rimraf customer_payment_report_module-content.zip dist"becomes"clean": "node_modules/rimraf/bin.js customer_payment_report_module-content.zip dist"

Hello SAP
Thank you very much for your help
After testing, the ySO_Manage project is ready to deploy and publish

But there are other projects that need to be deployed and released that have the same problems

Please provide a very detailed solution and operation steps, and I will deal with other projects that need to be deployed on my own

Thank you very much 2021-12-02 14:16:26 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
Further to 's response, I've managed to get the project building correctly. You are using npx which is re-downloadng packages which are causing the timeout error which in turn fails the build. npx is nice way to run node binaries that are installed via your node_modules folder but this is not working in your environment.
I also had to drop your existing package-lock as this was causing other issues, so there is a fresh package-lock.json with the latest installed modules.
I've tweaked the `->package.json` to use the absoluate path for the zipping and cleanup tasks. You can now build and deploy your application by right clicking on the root mta.yaml and building.
I dont know the work around for the npx issue, unless you are restricted from downloading a specific package but running these steps on my own BAS devspace, everything works fine.
Please let me know if you have any other issues.
 2021-12-02 13:50:19 -  (I305274) (External Info)
Hi customer,

Yes, if you have created a new dev space in BAS, the generators take some time to install.  However, the MTA generator (Basic Multi Target Application) was already installed in the screenshot you provided.  You should still be able to use this to generate an MTA file in BAS.

Regards

He prefer the developer could share the workaround/solution step by step. Currently it is a bit difficult to proceed the developer's workaround.
If possible, the customer wants a screenshare session with the developer to discuss directly.

Business impact:
Issue is affected a go-live project.
Prod go-live was scheduled at the end of Nov which has been delayed.
There're 3-4 apps are waiting to be deployed in the prod.
After this issue being fixed, the customer could deploy in the prod and go-live.
Showstopper. No workaround. 2021-12-02 02:39:24 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)

Hello SAP
Thank you for your solution.
We have known a little about VS Code before, but we are not familiar with it. Now the customer is very anxious and does not allow us to spend a lot of time on learning and testing.
Before this time, BAS was still able to directly generate MTA files. Why is it suddenly not working this time? If there is any problem, please restore the function immediately so that we can use it normally.
We will study and use your solution at the same time.

Product Area selected: SAP Fiori front-end server Component selected (Manual Selection): CA-UX-IDE --- Description --- We are running into errors with the internet connection of Fiori tools together with Visual Studio Code behind a corporate proxy.
In the following two use cases the data is not downloaded fully from the internet.
Fiori Application Generator > Minimum SAPUI5 version list is not complete Testing App preview show blank page Open the Application Generator (Template Wizard) and click on “Explore an Install Generators” on the upper right corner.
Environment:
On premise developer notebooks with Windows 10 Visual Studio Code Version 1.73.1 We are using the newest version of fiori tools extension pack and node.js. The proxy settings are configured in .npmrc and in the windows env variables. These settings have been tested and are correct.
For each of the use cases a detailed error description is attached.
We analyzed the issue deeper together with our colleague from the network department. The problem is that the tool tries to access an external source directly with a GET command, e.g.:
GET https://ui5.sap.com/neo-app.json HTTP/1.1 Accept: application/json, text/plain, */* X-Csrf-Token: Fetch User-Agent: axios/0.26.0 host: ui5.sap.com Proxy-Authorization: Basic […] Connection: close
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request Cache-Control: no-cache Pragma: no-cache X-XSS-Protection: 1 Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8 Proxy-Connection: close Connection: close Content-Length: 1099
However, since the tool is behind a proxy, a CONNECT must first occur for a successful GET command:
Example:
CONNECT webanalytics2.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com:443 HTTP/1.1 Proxy-Authorization: Basic […] Host: webanalytics2.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com Connection: close
HTTP/1.1 200 Connection established Best regards

Hi , sorry for the late reply. I was on sick leave. Yes, in some way the message relates with the issue. But it is only a symptom. The message is logged because our proxy denied the get due to the missing connect beforehand. However since a view days we have a new proxy infrastructure. And this is now able to tunnel the requests. Therefore from our sid we can close the incident as we no longer have this issue and can now load all ui versions in the app generator.
Thank you for your ongoing support. Should I close the incident? Best regards  2023-02-14 16:51:00 -  (I305274) (External Info)
Hello ,
I have had an engineer look at this issue in a little more detail, with a view to trying to replicate it on our side.  When looking through the attached logs from "Application Wizard - List of min UI Version.pdf", you can see the following debug entry when trying to retrieve the list of UI5 versions:
"label": "Application Wizard.AbstractWebviewPanel.@sap/fiori:app.@sap/generator-fiori", "level": "debug", "message": "[Axios][Error] GET https://ui5.sap.com/versionoverview.json 400:Bad Request {\"cachecontrol\":\"no-cache\",\"pragma\":\"no-cache\",\"x-xss-protection\":\"1\",\"proxy-connection\":\"close\"} \" \\r\ Request Error \\r\ \\r\ \\r\ face=\\\"Helvetica\\\">\\r\Generali \\r\ \\r\ \\r\ \\r\ \\r\ face=\\\"Helvetica\\\">\\r\Request Error (invalid_request)\\r\ \\r\ \\r\ \\r\ \\r\ \\r\ face=\\\"Helvetica\\\">\\r\Your request could not be processed.

It looks like your corporate proxy is blocking access to this UI5 version request (https://ui5.sap.com/versionoverview.json).  Could that be the reason why it is failing?  If not, we will continue our investigation.

Hi , the open issue was, that the list of currently supported ui versions can not be downloaded in the Application Wizard when creating a new freestyle app. We did not have a workaround, that was able to get through the proxy. Instead we use one of the hard coded ui versions of fiori tools and change the version of the app after the app was generated. Best regards,  2023-02-03 13:28:40 -  (I305274) (External Info)
Hi ,
Would you be able to detail how you managed to work around the corporate proxy issue below when we met in December?  Was it because you put the username and password in the proxy URL?
Thank you,

2023-01-31 07:53:58 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi ,

thanks for the update! It's good to hear, that you are trying to solve the issue thoroughly.
Looking forward to hearing from you again. Best regards,  2023-01-23 16:47:36 -  (I305274) (External Info)
Hi ,
Just to let you know this issue is still under active investigation.  Even though you were able to work around the issue for you, we'd like to provide a seamless solution with this type of corporate proxy.

Hopefully in the next few weeks we can provide an update here.

Best regards,

2022-12-19 14:07:34 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi , thank you for the time invested! I changed the priority to low, as we now have a workaround. My colleague sent me the following subpart of the proxy configuration, which he thinks is relevant to you: !- BEGIN proxies caching ;mode max-cache-size 1073 always-verify-source exit

create http "HTTP"edit "HTTP" ;mode add all explicit 8080 intercept attribute detect-protocol enable exit
!- BEGIN proxies im http-handoff enable streaming real-media multicast disable!- END proxies Additionally there is a extensive policy. But since this gives a deep insight in all settings, he does not want to share it.
He checks if he finds a special policy regarding the requirement of the COMMIT (forwarding of GET). Should he find something additional I will send you a message.

Regards  2022-12-19 10:51:44 -  (I305274) (External Info)
Hi ,
Thanks for meeting with us last week, and sorry that the problem still exists (even if you are able to now work around it).  As discussed in the call, if you could get some details on the configuration of corporate proxy that your network administration are implementing that would be great.

Many thanks,

2022-12-15 11:52:38 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hello , I was able to validate with my colleague from network that the proxy settings on my PC are correct. All requests from VSC / fiori tools are forewarded to the proxy. But the proxy blocks the requests because they use a "simple" GET instead of a "CONNECT" command. Till tomorrow  2022-12-14 13:47:05 -  (I305274) (External Info)
Hello ,
I have setup a meeting with your for 2PM CET on Friday, along with some colleagues.  Hopefully we can help you resolve the issue.
In the meantime, I did install a proxy locally that has basic authentication, so perhaps similar to yourself.  I was able to replicate the issue by adding this proxy to my settings in VSCode, but without the username and password.  Would you be able to do the following ahead of our meeting:

1. In VSCode, launch "Settings" and search for "proxy"
2. You should find a setting called "Http: Proxy".  In this box please type the proxy URL along with your username and password, so that if your username is "user" and your password is "pass", then the url you provide should be something like:

http://user:pass@localhost:8080

Where "localhost:8080" should be replaced with your corporate proxy URL. Perhaps this may make a difference?

Looking forward to talking on Friday.

Regards,
 2022-12-14 07:32:54 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)

Thank you for your detailed investigation for this issue.  Would you be available for a call to discuss this with some of our experts this week?  Would 2pm CET on Thursday work for you?  If so, please provide your email address and I can setup a meeting.  If it doesn't work, would Friday suit?

Please let me know,
Thanks

Hi ,
Yes, all those dependencies have updated as well.
See https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sap//v/3.2.17?activeTab=explore (from 3.2.15 is fixed)
and https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sap/xsodata/v/8.0.2?activeTab=explore
and https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sap//v/6.7.4?activeTab=explore
It is possible that afterwards the lock file may need to be rebuilt.
If for instance you are using a standard npm build, you can delete the package-lock.json file and run npm install again, this will re generate the lock file.
The npm command npm ls --all --no-workspaces --include dev jsonwebtoken can be used to confirm that the expected non vulnerable version is being used.
If you use other build systems (such as yarn or pnpm) the commands will be different and the npm commands should not be used.
Best regards,
. 2023-02-08 10:07:44 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi , Thanks for the update. Only @sap/approuter is updated? What about other packages? We have direct dependency of below packages as well and those are having jsonwebtoken version 8.5.1. @sap/ @sap/ @sap/xsodata Best Regards,  2023-02-03 21:50:22 -  (I057368) (External Info)
Hi ,
Please note that a new version of the @sap/approuter module has been released, please use version 13.1.0 or higher.
This has all it dependencies updated so that they depend on at least version 9.0.0 of the jsonwebtoken module.
The latest version is 13.1.1, which was released 4 days ago.

This is the base module fix, but there will be more fixes to the dependent modules that will need to be tracked as the updated versions get published.

Hi ,
Thank you for your report on the potential finding.
SAP colleagues already aware and have audited the code in question and it usage and found that no usage involves the vulnerable code paths.
The module concerned is being updated anyway, however as it is a major version change and there are possibly breaking changes it took time to fix and validate those fixes.
Please give some time as the updated module is now updated up through the chain of dependent modules.

Best regards,
.

We want to develop Fiori Apps on Cloud Foundry Business Application Studio. However accessing the OData Service in the Backend using defined Destinations on BTP does not work. Kind regards,
 2023-01-23 16:10:39 -  (I556404) (External Info)
Dear ,
I started to work on your inquiry on OPU-GW-V4, selected manually by you. I tried to log on to your DFA system which is linked to this case by default and wanted to check /IWFND/V4_ADMIN, to see whether there are indeed OData V4 services, but connection to this OnPrem is not open and no credentials are maintained. Based on your error description it is still not likely that the current component can help much further, at least not at this stage. We'll try to seek out the correct team to address the 'Services Unavailable' error.
For deeper understanding I also opened the Fiori tools support page you mentioned and have seen that it explicitly advises to open a case to CA-UX-IDE, attaching the envcheck file. You also mentioned that you created a log. Can you please attach it to the ticket? You also mentioned that setup looks good - can you expand on this a bit?
Basically I'd like to ask you to summarize the problem again in more detail with technical data which you deem useful, (feel free to use screenshots as well for visualization) and provide the steps to reproduce - if there is a way to reproduce it by us on support side. We'd like to ask you to maintain HTTP connection (as per SAP Note ##592085) and R/3 connection to the affected OnPrem system as described in SAP Note ##812732 and maintain logon data in Secure Area. Please note that we might also need to know the SID of the involved could system so we can apply for access to your cloud environment internally in order to be able to investigate more thoroughly.

Hello , Thanks for the explanation and the  blog. I will try this step and let you know. Yes, I was able to get "reachable" when I tried with HTTPS in cloud connector and that is why I got confused!! Regards,  *PHONE* 2021-11-09 11:00:17 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
If the SSL flow is failing then it could be that your cloud connector setup is restricting paths over HTTPS and/or the HTTPS path is disallowing catalog requests.
Have a look at this blog regarding setting up a cloud connector
https://blogs.sap.com/2020/12/23/principal-propagation-setup-with-sap-s-4hana-on-premise-system-and-sap-cloud-platform/
Also, on your cloud connector, to validate a connection to your backend SAP system, select the "Check Availability" icon under "Actions" and make sure "Check Result" comes back "Reachable". In your case, you might have a http and https configured.

Hello , I investigate it further and  I noticed that when I select HTTPS in "Cloud to on-premise" configuration I am getting this error.

Thank you  *PHONE* 2021-11-08 22:07:40 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hello , I recreated the destination (DGW) from BAS and I noticed, after system creation it is not fetching any services. Please see attached screenshot.

Hi,
Once you've confirmed if you are subscribed to the portal or launchpad service, then these are the links to use;
Portal Service
https://scidev-jnrw5nrl.cpp.cfapps.ca10.hana.ondemand.com/dynamic_dest/DGW/sap/opu/odata/ui2/FDM_PAGE_REPOSITORY_CUST_SRV/
Launchpad Service
https://scidev-jnrw5nrl.launchpad.cfapps.ca10.hana.ondemand.com/dynamic_dest/DGW/sap/opu/odata/ui2/FDM_PAGE_REPOSITORY_CUST_SRV/
The launchpad service is the preferred subscription for handling HTML5 applications.
Let me know if you need anything else.
 2021-11-01 20:59:37 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hello , Sorry for delayed reply. I am still checking on this and will get back to once I have an answer. Thanks  *PHONE* 2021-10-26 09:55:20 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
The correct URL for validaying with a dynamic destination is
https://scidev-jnrw5nrl.launchpad.cfapps.ca10.hana.ondemand.com/dynamic_dest/DGW/sap/opu/odata/ui2/FDM_PAGE_REPOSITORY_CUST_SRV/
This is returning an internal server error.
Please ensure you have subscribed to the launchpad service in your subaccount where the destination is configured? If you are subscribed to the portal service then the url will be different.
Also, are you able to see any logs on your cloud connector/on prem servers?
Are you trying to expose a catalog of services or an individual service? Exposing a catalog of services requires additional parameters to be configured;
Here are some additional linksl
https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/abap-custom-ui-business-object.html
Please refer to Step5 - “Create IAM App and business catalog” to ensure the catalog is exposed correctly https://github.com/SAPDocuments/Tutorials/blob/62a65ead5012ebcea7b0204a376b7d33e1693ef5/tutorials/abap-environment-vs-code/abap-environment-vs-code.md

Hello , Did you get a chance to look into it. As in the screenshot, I am not able to see services, and this could be because of the connection issue to DGW system.

Hello , Thank you for the detailed steps, I was able to move little bit further after following your recommendations.  When I checked the steps in BTP, points 1 to 10 are configured correctly. Then I generate the link, but I am getting "your Connection is private" error. As you mentioned in point 12, I don't have WebIDEUsage which I added and then I can see the 'Service"  under "Data source and service selection", but with error "All catalog service requests failed for system: DGW. OData version(s): V2, V4." So I checked 3063160 and tested URL https://scmt016.scigroup.com/sap/opu/odata/ui2/FDM_PAGE_REPOSITORY_CUST_SRV/ please see the screenshot for details. All other points in the Note is configured correctly.  Not sure what I am missing here. I opened gateway system DGW and saved credential in secure area, can you please take a look?

Hi,
To independently validate your destination configuration, follow these steps;
1. In your SAP BTP Cockpit, select your subaccount overview page
2. Please ensure you have subscribed to the Launchpad Service before proceeding
3. Note subaccount `Subdomain` i.e. my-name-company
4. Note the API endpoint region i.e. https://api.cf.eu10.hana.ondemand.com thus the region will be eu10
5. Select Destinations under Connectivity tab on the left navigation bar
6. Filter the destinations
7. Select your destination i.e. MyDestination
8. 
9. Set the following Additional Property, if not already set;
HTML5.DynamicDestination: true
10. Save your settings
11. Generate the link as follows;
https://.launchpad.cfapps..hana.ondemand.com/dynamic_dest/ /
For example: https://my-name-company.launchpad.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/dynamic_dest/MyDestination/sap/opu/odata/sap/My_Business_Service/$metadata
12. Open a new browser to validate the URL is working i.e. assuming its an OData Service, XML should be returned
I've also noticed that you have not defined any WebIDEUsage properties to determine what kind of endpoint you are trying to expose  ie. an OData Service, a REST API, for more info please refer to https://help.sap.com/doc/97abfdee97f744ed8987154fe3a78c0f/CF/en-US/SAP_Web_IDE_en.pdf page 57.
In our current release, it's expected that the destination being exposed is an OData service catalog unless you specify using the additional properties  fields to specify if it's an odata service of type full or partial.

Hello, I did configure destination, can you please check the attachment (Destination.docx) to see that is what you are mentioning here. But I did not create service key for ABAP system. If possible, can you please call me at *PHONE* so that I can share my screen and you can take a look to resolve this issue ASAP. Thanks  *PHONE* 2021-10-20 04:40:13 -  (I802475) (External Info)
Hi ,
It sounds like you haven't set up a destination to the backend system. Unless you are using an Odata service with a URL that is publicly accessible via internet, a destination needs to be defined in the BTP Cockpit. Refer to https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/e597948462fe45c98c10269bbe3603d6.html
The setup depends on quite a few things in BTP. I recommend that you reach out to your BTP admin so the backend system is properly exposed to the cloud and the destination is setup up for you.

Hello, Thanks for the detailed explanation. When I go to service center, I don't see any system there. Please see attached screenshot. Do I have to add new system there? Thanks  *PHONE* 2021-10-19 03:16:55 -  (I802475) (External Info)
Dear customer,
Thank you for reporting this to us. To help to isolate the problem, can you please help to do the following:
1. In the activity bar (left navigation bar in your workspace), click on the "Service Center" icon
2. Find the destination/system you are using
3. Log on if necessary
Checkpoint #1: Do you see "Available" for both V2/V4 Catalog Status?
If shows "available" for the Odata version you are using, please continue with the steps:
4. Double click service you are trying to use, you should see "Service Action" button enabled
5. Click on the "Service Action" and click on "Create Project from Service". Can the project be generated?
If checkpoint #1 or Step 4 failed, it is likely that this is a connectivity issue. Please execute the following commands, one by one, at the terminal replacing with the name of the destination you are using. After each step, you should see a file created in the workspace with the name specified after the ">" in the command.
Please include all the files in a zip file and attach to this case.
1. "curl $H2O_URL/api/listDestinations > destinations.json"
2. "curl -v -i.dest > destAccessHeader.txt"
3. "curl -v.dest > destAccessData.txt"

Hi,
It would be great if you set up a call since you need to make a decision on how to manage the deployment of your existing app into your new subaccount. My email address is *EMAIL* if you would like to set up a call today, Thursday June 30th.
Your application is currently built on the portal service but this service is not available on your new subaccount. You are now subscribed to the Launchpad service which manages HTML5 applications and deployment differently.
Please refer to https://blogs.sap.com/2020/09/11/html5-applications-managed-by-sap-cloud-platform-the-new-way-of-developing-html5-apps/ for a deeper understanding of the new HTML5 repo approach.
Your existing mta.yaml needs to be changed to support how the deployment works, now to remove the dependency on the portal service which impacts your routing in the app xs-app.json and also how to switch to a managed approuter approach thus removing the dependency on the approuter.
However, depending on your contact and agreement with SAP, portal service in some instances, is still available but you would need to discuss this with your account manager to understand how your new subaccount can be configured to support this.
Some of these points might be better discussed over a sharing session.
Also, to address the npm version, you can configure the engines attribute in your root package.json, please refer to https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/configuring-npm/package-json#engines

Hi, starting from startup log of srv app I noticed the message in the attached screen "update_npm.jpg". Despite I have ran the command ( -g *EMAIL*) in BAS terminal and after the command (npm --version) in the terminal shows the right version "8.13.2" the startup log of srv app shows same the message. How can I do to update the library? 2022-06-28 14:59:03 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Sorry, I forgot to include this link
https://blogs.sap.com/2020/12/23/how-to-move-portal-service-to-launchpad-service-in-different-subaccount/
This might provide some clarity around moving from subaccounts using different portal / launchpad services.
 2022-06-28 14:03:30 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
Based on my findings, I think we need to have a discussion on what the next steps are, for the following reasons;
1. Your existing setup will not work based on the current dependency versions
2. The new global account is setup with launchpad service but your existing config is expecting the portal service
3. Your existing configuration is using an approuter and the recommendation is to switch to using a managed approuter, there are pros/cons with each ie. standalone | managed approuter
I've managed to get your app deployed but it's not working as expected and requires further changes.
Unfortunately this refactor of your application/configuration is not part of our Fiori Tools remit but I'm happy to discuss with you my findings and possible next steps.
Please email *EMAIL* with meeting details, anytime after 14hrs Irish GMT +1 time.
Thanks.

3. only launchpad service is subscribed 4. neither launchpad nor portal service are subscribed 2022-06-27 16:06:13 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
Just a quick update, I'm still looking at your issue. There are a couple of issues related to your deployementl

1. Outdated versions, a number of your package.json in the respective packages all need to be updated
2. The initial blocking error is related to deployer which is using @sap/portal-cf-content-deployer and needs removed, please refer to the following link for more info
https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sap/portal-cf-content-deployer
3. Have you subscribed to both portal and launchpad service on Global ID: CA11839816TID000000000741072994
4. Were you subscribed only to the portal service on Global ID: CA23273356TID000000000740882082
5. If you make the required changes outlined in point 2, there are still issues with the bit-tickets-srv module which Im still looking at.
I hope to have something working tomorrow for you.

Hi,
I'm working on the Fiori Tools team and I'm currently investigating your deployment issue.
I'm trying to understand a few things;
1. How was the CAP project generated? Did you follow a tutorial? Migrate this from another subaccount?
Note: you stated that this is an initial deployment so the assumption is, this app is currently not deployed anywhere
2. In your SAP BTP subaccount, please select HTML5 Applications tab and take a screen shot of the page and attach it to the support ticket. Can you confirm if you are subscribed to Launchapd service or portal service?
To understand the differences between portal and launchpad services, please refer to this post
https://answers.sap.com/questions/13298410/launchpad-service-vs-cloud-portal-service.html
Also, a number of your dependencies in the respective package.json files are either depreciated or obsolete.
This is another tutorial that shows how to use the Launchpag serivce using a managed approuter thus leverage a serverless architecture provided out of the box by SAP.

Hi,
I will take a look at the issue but this is not a Fioro Tools related issue. They are not using any of our tooling nor where the apps/configs generated using our tooling.

Dear colleagues,
Customer has an MTA application with launchpad module and fails when deploying the app. In the app log you can see the error below:

I found a similar case here: https://answers.sap.com/questions/12997765/launchpad-deployment-failed-in-sap-cloud-platform.html and this SAP note and I suspect the issue is with his launchpad module and the settings in his app.
Can you please have a look and try to assist him?

Dear Colleagues,

Hi ,
from what I can tell, this is not an encoding issue because the ASCII characters in question are displayed.
If you look at the following file:
https://razrsapdev004.riachuelo.net:44300/sap/bc/ui5_ui5/sap/zbsp_fi_asset_m/~B7CE21148189156919CB4BD9327F9487~5/Component-preload.js
and search for
\\u00c3\\u00a7\\u00c3\\u00a3 You can see that this sequence appears several times. When looking at an ASCII table this translates to
Ã § Ã £
Which is exactly what is displayed in the faulty strings.
Therefore, the issue must happen before the app reaches the launchpad (maybe during build or deployment).
Thanks and best regards

Hi.
I believe the error is when deploying, because the file being saved as a BSP Application has the file "i18n_pt_BR.properties" written wrongly, as shown below: trackExecution=Acompanhar Execu\u00c3\u00a7\u00c3\u00a3o
As it is the BSP application that is exposed on Fiori Launchpad, it ends up being harmed.
The real question is: Why does it work in SAP Business Application Studio but send the file incorrectly to BSP Application/Launchpad?
I think you can check what's going on during deployment to try to figure out why you're sending the file with the accents written in the wrong encoding.
It may be the lack of some implementation, some configuration in SAP BAS or something like in the tool.
Best Regards,  . 2021-06-02 12:40:51 -  (D022159) (External Info)
Hello , If so, let me first forward to the FLP colleagues for assistance. @FLP: would you please give some advise what exactly needs to be maintained so that the UTF-8 characters get correctly displayed for Brazil? What is the workaround for the customer? And if you see any gap in the generated deployment configuration from our side (Fiori tools suite), please specify what needs to be done and pass the ticket back to our CA-UX-IDE queue. Thanks & regards,  2021-06-02 11:31:58 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi, how are You doing?
A freestyle application was created, using only SAP Business Application Studio as a tool.
I used 2 screen shots to exemplify the right and wrong way.
Character error only happens in Fiori Launchpad. When creating in SAP Business Application Studio and using the following code in the ui5.yaml file, the error disappeared(In SAP BAS):resources:     configuration:         propertiesFileSourceEncoding: UTF-8 However, when publishing the application on FIORI LAUNCHPAD, the character error still exists. Explaining the screenshots: The right way is as it is in SAP BAS. The wrong way is how it is being displayed in FIORI LAUNCHPAD.But we need the bug to be fixed in FIORI LAUNCHPAD.We need a fix for FIORI LAUNCHPAD(the wrong way in Screenshot_10).

Hello , You have added a lot of attachments, but the scenario is not completely clear. First, your zip looks like you have created a free-style app. Did you use the app generator of the Fiori tool-suite? Because that's the component you addressed to. Second, you added some screenshots of what is Ok and what is wrong. But I could not find any explanation on how you produced the OK or the error case. What was the difference? The reference to the resource model seems to be OK in the manifest of your zip. But I also wonder about the general set-up that I can find here: at the beginning you refer to an OData service of V2, but the rest of the manifest follows the V4 paradigms. This may also cause some trouble at run-time. Please clarify your scenario and your issues in more details so that we can help. Best regards,   2021-06-01 09:02:27 -  (D022159) (External Info)

Hi ,
I've attached a video (deploy.mp4) to show the steps I've done. Could you please verify you have the same result? I ran command npm run deploy without and with the resource configuration. With the configuration I can see the correct encoding is applied. If you still face the issue, could you please do the following:
- add resource configuration to ui5-deploy.yaml (you might have this already)
- deploy the application to ABAP backend
- login to ABAP backend and start transaction SE80
- switch to BSP application ZBSP_FI_ASSET_M
- Open "Page Fragments" -> "i18n" -> "i18n_pt_BR.properties"
- Check the content for encoding
does it contain
trackExecution=Acompanhar Execu\u00e7\u00e3o

or

trackExecution=Acompanhar Execu\u00c3\u00a7\u00c3\u00a3o

?

Kind regards,

Hi 
Thanks, now I was able to reproduce the issue and we are working on a fix. Meanwhile, could you please also add the lines:

resources:
configuration:
propertiesFileSourceEncoding: UTF-8

to the file ui5-deploy.yaml in the root of your project and retry deployment?

Kind regards,

2021-05-19 18:54:57 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Before opening the call, we had already taken the steps.
Even so, we did it again and yes, the file "dist/i18n/i18n_pt_BR.properties"  contains the following line: trackExecution=Acompanhar Execu\u00e7\u00e3o However, the line goes back to the following way, after the deployment: trackExecution=Acompanhar Execu\u00c3\u00a7\u00c3\u00a3o. If you run the "npm run build" command and check the file in the dist folder, it is "on the right track". If you check after executing the "npm run deploy" command, the file will return to the same state it was in, before executing the "npm run build".
After deploy, we checked the LPD, however, the error persists! Best regards,  . 2021-05-19 17:19:38 -  (D045154) (External Info)

Hi ,
Sorry, I was wrong, the project you've attached (manageassetregistration (1).tar) has initially wrong encoding in dist/i18n/i18n_pt_BR.properties, but after I execute npm run build, the file looks correct. Could you please open the project and execute command npm run build in the terminal in root folder of the project (where package.json is located) and check the file dist/i18n/i18n_pt_BR.properties? If it contains the text

trackExecution=Acompanhar Execu\u00e7\u00e3o

after you execute the build, could you please deploy again and check in FLP?

Hi ,
I have troubles reproducing the issue. The project you've shared shows the correct encoding in dist/i18n files, e.g.:

trackExecution=Acompanhar Execu\u00e7\u00e3o

However, the dist.zip you've attached earlier shows the wrong encoding:

trackExecution=Acompanhar Execu\u00c3\u00a7\u00c3\u00a3o

Did you try to undeploy the app and redeploy it with the project you have attached?

Kind regards,

Hi. The code already has this line of code in the ui5.yaml file. Attached is the complete application file, for a better analysis. Regards,  . 2021-05-13 18:13:17 -  (D045154) (External Info)
Solution provided: Add following to your ui5.yaml file

resources:
configuration:
propertiesFileSourceEncoding: UTF-8

2021-05-13 18:13:16 -  (D045154) (External Info)
Dear ,
You can maintain the i18n files in src folder with special characters, but then you need to add following to your ui5.yaml file

resources:
configuration:
propertiesFileSourceEncoding: UTF-8

After you do this, the command npm run build will correctly escape the i18n files in dist folder.
Another possibility is to to have the encoded strings already in your src folder, then it should always be correctly displayed. See also:
https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/topic/df86bfbeab0645e5b764ffa488ed57dc -> Conventions:

Use Unicode escape sequences for special characters.

That means the string in your i18n file in src folder would be:

trackExecution=Acompanhar Execu\u00e7\u00e3o.

There are helpers to convert from native to ascii escaped, for instance an extension for Visual Studio Code: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cwan.native-ascii-converter or just do a search for "native to ascii converter".

Hope this help!

Kind regards,

UX Engineering

Hi. What do you see in the i18n_pt_BR.properties in the src folder? Are they different to what we in the dist folder? Yes. in the i18n_pt_BR.properties, in the src folder, I see like: trackExecution=. Thank you. Can you tell me how exactly the artifacts are generated for deployment? Command line tool or any process/command used. I'm trying to figure if some tool is transforming the texts incorrectly. I only used Business Application Studio in the development of this application. I didn't use another external tool. Just the basic. 2021-05-10 20:44:49 -  (I031735) (External Info)
Hi ,

Thanks for attaching the contents of the dist folder.
As you may be aware, the translations are in file: dist/i18n/i18n_pt_BR.properties
Taking one line as an example:
trackExecution=Acompanhar Execu\u00c3\u00a7\u00c3\u00a3o
Here "Execu\u00c3\u00a7\u00c3\u00a3o" gets decoded to ExecuÃ§Ã£o
"Execução" should be actually encoded as Execu\u00e7\u00e3o. The contents in the properties file are not what we're expecting.

What do you see in the i18n_pt_BR.properties in the src folder? Are they different to what we in the dist folder?
The application was developed in UI5, in the Business Application Studio tool.
Thank you. Can you tell me how exactly the artifacts are generated for deployment? Command line tool or any process/command used. I'm trying to figure if some tool is transforming the texts incorrectly.

Could you also let us know how exactly deployment is being done? What command/tool is being used etc.

Is it possible to share the project with us? If so, could you include the contents of the dist folder too (if any). I'm wondering if the translations files are correctly being included/generated before the deploy.

Dear Colleagues,

when trying to access the application on the Fiori launchpad, the translations, whose words use special characters, are unreadable, with several unknown special characters. For example: The text of the button should be "Execução" instead of " ExecuÃ§Ã£o".
This issue only occurs in Portugese Language.

Dear customer, Sorry, I cannot find the name  "Upload and update assets in bulk" or "Upload and update bulk assets" in library .

The application name, in Brazilian Portuguese is: "Carregar e Atualizar Ativos em ". Translated to English, it would be "Upload and update assets in bulk" or "Upload and update bulk assets". The reproduction step would be: Log in in Portuguese language and run the application. Note that the texts on the bottom 2 buttons on the left side will show the error. 2021-03-17 05:34:04 -  (I062981) (External Info)

Product Area selected: SAP S/4HANA > Service Component selected (Manual Selection): CA-UX-IDE --- Description --- Dear SAP Support Team,
I’m developing a Fiori application in Visual Studio Code, but I get a 404 error when connecting to Odata. As a background, this issue occurred after enabling SAML authentication, and was temporarily avoided by adding a SAML disabled parameter (?saml2=disabled) to the URI. But finally the SAML disabled parameter (?saml2=disabled) is unnecessary and should be removed. (There is also the risk that deletion omissions will occur during deployment and the quality of the application will be degraded.)
Are there other viable alternatives? Best regards.

Hello IT-, Just wanted to add that, without understanding your full configuration and application requirements its hard to provide an exact answer. Different configurations are applied if running on premise or on cloud. In my other reply I have shared some general notes on getting started with SAML, configuring different destinations to support SAML and some additional links that you can refer to. Additionally, here are two more useful resources https://blogs.sap.com/ and https://answers.sap.com/ Kind regards, . 2022-10-06 12:48:01 -  (I320242) (External Info)

Hello IT-, To use destinations for development, they would need a little more configuration as there is no identity management in development environment.
Please consider the following links HTTP Destinations - please consider different authentication types, and where your destination is - local vs cloud.

The destinations need to be configured to be trusted to use SAML. OAuth SAML Bearer Destination Using SAML Bearer Assertion Authentication SAML Assertion Authentication

Or consider switching to basic authentication in your Dev env or use OAuth (e.g. OAuth2SAMLBearerAssertion) or Principal Propagation. E.g. SAML is replaced in favour of OAuth in this Tutorial

Just to let you know, as you are in Dev environment, I am going to lower the priority of this ticket.

Kind regards, .

Dear Customer,

Thank you providing the extra details, in the document “Error in BAS Part 2.docx”

So based on the 2 documents you have provided we believe your issue is not caused by Fiori Tools(CA-UX-IDE).

We believe there is an issue somewhere between the cloud connector and the on Prem system
It could be related to creating a secure connection from the CC to the OnPrem system, perhaps caused by a firewall or something

In the document : Error in BAS.docx, you ran an odata test & you ran this test over http, but we can see that the cloud connector is configured via https (see image 2 & 6)
We suggest that you
1. enable logging on the cloud connector
2. re-run this test using https
3. Then checks the logs of the cloud connector, as there might be better logs there that will identify the issue.

I would also suggest that you look at the following 2 documents, as they may help to solve your issue.
firewall issue https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2377425
Cloud connector : https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2930080

Hi ,
Can you enable debug logging for deployment by entering the following in the BAS terminal?
export AXIOS_LOG='true' npm run deploy and send us the logs. What sort authentication does is enabled on that server e.g. , Form, SSO, SAML, etc..?

Over the holiday period we have low levels of support available so please allow for slower response times. Thanks,

They say that there is no URLs in the code and that the app doesn't use destinations. The app uses an OData endpoint pointing to https://api4preview.sapsf.com/odata/v2.
They say that everything was working normal until the update to Node. Also, if they create another identical project but with a lower Node version, it works without issues. Is there an impact to using the latest Node version?
They cannot attach an export of the project due to sensitive data. Could you assist with this? The MPT is nearing 100%.

Hello , We may not be able to provide the entire export of the project due to the sensitive nature of it. But we can provide specific files from it as needed. I also wanted to make you aware that we created another workspace which doesn't have the latest version of node installed and the project works in that workspace. This seemed like the quickest workaround for us to continue so I think we can drop the priority of this ticket to High instead of Very High. Also, would you be able to help us with how to disable updates to workspaces? This might become a bigger issue later if another dev space gets updated.

Hello , No the application is using an odata endpoint, not a system destination. The odata endpoint is a https endpoint. https://api4preview.sapsf.com/odata/v2.

Hi ,
Thanks for the info. In that case, is this application using any BTP destinations with type On-Premise, but with https in the URL? If so, please change to http, or, if the URL is publicly accessible, change the type to Internet.
If the issue persists, could you please attach here an export of the project in BAS?

We need your urgent assistance on this CI/CD Tools for SAP BTP ABAP Environment topic in our BTP account.
We have 2 Sub-Account (DEV & QA) both are in the same Global account. Now we need to configure gCTS type connection between this Sub-Account from Git Repository manually. We have got below link where SAP explain this CI/CD tools using Jenkins Server and make this automated.
https://open.sap.com/courses/devops1/items/7Gwx7DuVVCXUWzSAo0PVFo (Bonus Content Unit 1: CI/CD Tools in SAP BTP, ABAP Environment)
But we do not want this setup as we do not wanted to use Jenkins Server. We wanted direct setup from GIT to ABAP Cloud so that. From GIT Repository to DEV account code will be stored than that can be transported to QA account manfully. So could you provide us the steps as we did not found any proper documents about the steps.

Could you check which version of "@sap/ux-ui5-tooling" library is used in your project? You can check the "_id" field in package.json file resides under: /node_modules/@sap/ux-ui5-tooling/package.json. The latest release version of "@sap/ux-ui5-tooling" is 1.5.5. You can install it with the following steps: First, open package.json file at your project root folder. Find the following section:

"devDependencies": {......
"@sap/ux-ui5-tooling": "1"
}, Change "@sap/ux-ui5-tooling" version to 1.5.5:
"devDependencies": {......
"@sap/ux-ui5-tooling": "1.5.5"
},
Run "npm install" under your project root folder. You can verify the latest version is installed by checking the "_id" property in /node_modules/@sap/ux-ui5-tooling/package.json again. After installing the latest version, can you try to run yarn undeploy again and report if you still have problem with undeploy?

Hi colleagues, after checking with  he proposed to dispatch this incident to your component or CA-UI5-ABA-SAR. The customer is currently blocked. We proposed a deletion of all objects in /N4C02/MAIN. During the deletion of BSPs there occurred some errors. Can you check and help why this issue occurs for the customer? The mentioned H01 Dev System: https://bc.spc.ondemand.com/sap/bc/webdynpro/a1sspc/cam_wd_central?item=reqadmin&tenant_id=000000000740972555#

Hello , We are trying to delete objects from /N4C02/MAIN so we can then pull them from the abapGit repository to /N4C02/CNTCT_CNTR. However, we are having trouble deleting BSPs. These BSPs were created by running “fiori deploy” via “yarn deploy” in Business Application Studio (BAS). We cannot delete them manually in the ABAP Environment as this function is not supported and running “fiori  undeploy” via “yarn undeploy” does not work. I think the latter does not work because of an issue in the SAP standard code in the ABAP Environment. When running “yarn undeploy” an exception is raised in the following class method /iwcor/cl_ds_uri->raise_uri_syntax_invalid_segm:
This is because iv_segment contains one of the characters in gv_excluded_chars. In this case iv_segment equals “Repositories('” with the full URL being: /sap/opu/odata/UI5/ABAP_REPOSITORY_SRV/Repositories(%27/N4C02/CUST_RET_SEARCH%27)?CodePage=%27UTF8%27&CondenseMessagesInHttpResponseHeader=X&format=json&TransportRequest=H01K900065

It raises that exception as iv_segment contains “(“. In BAS I see the error mention in the attachment).
Is there a workaround for this at the moment while it is being fixed? We have taken some screenshot in the attachment. Please help to check in the attachment. Thanks & Regards,  2022-04-28 07:37:29 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hello , Thank you so much for your guidance. We have shared below information to our team member. Now they will take care on this object movement task.

Mean time you can reduce the priority if you want. After few days we will close the ticket. Thank you again  for your help. Thanks & regards,  2022-04-27 14:21:40 -  (D070961) (External Info)
Solution provided: Hello ,
unfortunately it is not possible for us to move the /N4C02/MAIN package from ZLOCAL to the Software Component /N4C02/CNTCT_CNTR for you.
This is also stated in the official documentation for managing Software Components on the SAP Business Technology Platform: https://help.sap.com/docs/BTP/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/58480f43e0b64de782196922bc5f1ca0.html?locale=en-US&version=Cloud
"You can't move development objects from one software component to another. Thus, the introduction of software components should be planned carefully."
We were able to see that the /N4C02/MAIN package has been linked and imported with abapGit by you. As mentioned this was done within the ZLOCAL Software Component/Package.
However, it should be possible to move the objects from /N4C02/MAIN to /N4C02/CNTCT_CNTR for you with a workaround. For this you would need to delete all /N4C02/* objects/subpackages as well as the /N4C02/MAIN package itself from ZLOCAL and release/delete the transports where these objects reside in the H01 DEV system. My assumption is that these transports are also the ones that have been used to import /N4C02/MAIN originally. Afterwards you can import the /N4C02/MAIN package into the Software Component /N4C02/CNTCT_CNTR with abapGit measures again as you have already done but within the wrong Software Component ZLOCAL.
Sorry for the inconvenience. I hope this helps.

Hello , Noted with thanks. Thank you so much for your help and guidance. Thanks & Regards,  2022-04-27 10:38:29 -  (D070961) (External Info)
Hello ,
just a quick update on the current process:
We have checked the H01 DEV System for the existence of the /N4C02/MAIN package. We could observe that this package was indeed imported with abapGit measures into the ZLOCAL software component of this system. With the ZLOCAL Software component being assigned to the /N4C02/MAIN package there will be no Transport Layer/Route that can be used. So the contents of /N4C02/MAIN can not be moved from DEV to QA accounts right now.
Also this prevents the creation of the same objects under the /N4C02/CNTCT_CNTR Software Component, since these objects are already present in the ZLOCAL Software Component with the appropriate namespace.
We are now trying to find a way to re-assign the /N4C02/MAIN package in order for it to belong to the /N4C02/CNTCT_CNTR Software Component instead of the ZLOCAL one.
Once I have new updates on this I will get back in touch with you asap.

Hello , Thank you so much for your help on this. Now we are able to use this Manage software Component for our developments. As discussed now we encounter another issue, Issue is for namespace /N4C02/ we already had package where our teams did some developments more than years. So look likes those are not part of Transport Route (or Software component), So to move those codes to QA. You are checking internally whether those developments changes to reassign to correct software components/transport route. So we will wait for your update on this, so that we can successfully moved our developments to QA system. Thank you  in advance for your guidance and support to fix this issue. Thanks & regards,  2022-04-26 13:58:07 -  (D070961) (External Info)
Solution provided: Hello ,
we have created the Software Component /N4C02/CNTCT_CNTR for you.
As mentioned via MS Teams, unfortunately we are limited to 18 characters when assigning a name for a Software Component.
Due to that it wasn't possible to give the Software Component the name /N4C02/CONTACT_CENTER. In agreement with  we have changed the name to /N4C02/CNTCT_CNTR.
You should now be able to use this Software Component for both your DEV as well as your QA subaccount.
If you have any questions left please reach out to us!

Hi ,
I have checked all the available namespaces on the H01 system for your DEV subaccount.
The namespaces were correctly imported into the H01 system.
However, I could observe that there is a limitation to the dropdown menu where you need to select the namespaces. There is a limit to show only 100 entries. That was why we weren't able to select the /N4C02/ namespace in todays call.
Sorry for this inconvenience. We are looking to provide a fix release for this problem as early as the 2205 Release hopefully which will extend the dropdown list to show more namespaces.
In the meantime, what we can offer you is to create the Software Component on behalf of you with the appropriate namespace being assigned.
For this we would need your agreement and the following information:
Namespace: /N4C02/ i guess? Name of the Software Component Description Repository Role: Source/Target
If you need help we can sync on MS Teams on the values of these parameters that we require for the creation of the software component. As I remember you already had all the required information for the Software Component creation planned and available in todays call so this might be the quicker solution for you than waiting for the 2205 Upgrade.
Let me know what option works best for you.

Solution provided: Hi ,
per default every Steampunk System will be configured with a "Git setup". This allows you to transport changes inside of software components between multiple systems inside of the same SAP BTP Global Account.
If you release transports from the DEV system they will be stored in a GIT Repository by us. Afterwards these changes can be imported to the QA system via the Software Component Lifecycle Management App. This can be used without any need for setup/interaction by you. Also there is no need to have a Jenkins Server for this need.
You can find the official documentation for the usage of the Software Component Lifecycle Management App under the following link to our official documentation: https://help.sap.com/docs/BTP/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/3dcf76a072c9450eb46b99db947dab46.html?locale=en-US&version=Cloud
Furthermore there is a tutorial on how to transport a software component between two systems with gCTS using the Software Component Lifecycle App: https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/abap-environment-gcts.html
Can you explain more in detail on why you want to setup/configure the gCTS connection manually?

Product Area selected: Non-Product Related Topics > SAP Support Portal (support.sap.com) > Maintenance Component selected (Manual Selection): CA-UX-IDE --- Steps to Reproduce --- NOTE TO SAP SUPPORT: I give my approval for SAP Support to reproduce the issue described, while connected to my impacted non-production environments, using any steps provided in the description below or provided later, even if the steps result in a change being made, until the issue is closed. --- Description --- Please see attachment for illustration. In the Fiori App generator in VSCode, we see the option to authenticate via username and password.  However, the recommended mechanism by SAP for authenticating users would be single sign on (e.g., SAP Secure Login Client, etc). For systems that are purely on SSO, do we have any configuration option that can be used to authenticate via x.509 certificate or other means?

Hi , I'd be more than happy to be a tester for you for the pre-release candidates and share my feedback as well.  Of course, happy to share my inputs too and maybe in one way or the other influence the outcome. If I am not mistaken, depending on the component, SAP would require as an agreement.  I am okay to sign such an agreement if you need me to. Thank you!  2022-12-02 16:38:48 -  (I829208) (External Info)
Hi ,
This is  from SAP Fiori tools and thanks for being proactive on this topic and tip. Much appreciated.
As you would have understood from my colleague , we we actively looking into this area as many other customers have asked. I cannot commit on a particular timeline as of today.
But if its okay, then I would like to keep in touch with you. Later when we are ready or we need more information , it will be awesome if we can include you as pre-release candidate for feedback/testing.
If you are interested, please feel free to reach out to me at *EMAIL* and also my counterpart *EMAIL*.

Hi , Thanks a lot for sharing this and most especially the link showing the authentication options. Just to share my inputs here, but no way I am insisting this.  In the Eclipse ADT world, there is support for certificate-based authentication, I believe, and I might be wrong, largely because of using SAP CommonCryptolib and JCo. If I am not mistaken, Fiori Tools on the other hand relies on HTTPS / TLS for communication to the backend. The beauty of using SAP Common CryptoLib is that in addition to creating its own memory store, it also writes into the Windows Certificate store, which means it can be used for certificate-based authentication also, not withstanding the use of SAP Common Cryptolib. Of course, this is easier said than done since you'd also have to consider cross-platform support like VSCode on Linux, VSCode on Mac and VSCode on Web where Common CryptoLib does not behave exactly the same way.  But I guess that's one way to start, in case someday, somehow we start considering other authentication options. Thank you!  2022-11-29 11:52:05 -  (I012956) (External Info)
Hi,

Unfortunately Fiori tools doesn't currently support SSO authentication, but please note that we actively investigating this topic. There are technical challenges we are trying to overcome and there is no guarantee at this point that it can be delivered.  The current auth methods are detailed at:
https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_FIORI_tools/17d50220bcd848aa854c9c182d65b699/17efa217f7f34a9eba53d7b209ca4280.html?locale=en-US#authentication-type-support

Customer has started experiencing this issue post-upgrade (upgraded from S4HANA 2020 FPS 01 to S4HANA 2021 FPS01, in the S4 level) and prior to that this application was working as expected. But post upgrade they redeployed the application and started facing this issue.

Based on the information They provided: "You are using SAP's own standard app router", we think they are using Managed .
If they are using Managed , the app will be available from HTML5 Content. They cannot use Manual Integration of apps. In this case the steps to consume the app in Launchpad are different, they have to use this: Run Applications in SAP Launchpad service | SAP Help Portal
They need to configure manifest.json as per Expose HTML5 Applications in SAP Launchpad service | SAP Help Portal
and then: HTML5 Apps Content Provider | SAP Help Portal To integrate apps and shell plugins from the HTML5 Apps content provider, They need to perform the 4 tasks that are mentioned in this link.

Dear Colleague,
We have analysed and debugged the issue over a call and found that the entityType in metadata and manifest are wrong, but when checking from the BTP and the browser there are some difference in both the manifest. This might be due to the caching issue of metadata. Please reach out to *EMAIL* for further information.

Dear colleagues,
The UI5 support team in product support has never owned this incident, so we don't have any information other than what is provided in the incident.   since this is Cf, the url is https://clfqut01.cpp.cfapps.us20.hana.ondemand.com/eebd8973-f0f3-4905-930b-6ea0551d7b32.zcontracthistroyreport.comsuncorr2rzcontracthistroyreport-1.0.0/index.html but you are going to have to ask the customer for credentials and steps.   There is no on premise system here.  BAS is the business application studio where the customer is doing their development and the application works.
I have asked the customer for now for the information you require, but in the future, especially when the incident is ESCALATED and moving from development team to development team you need to work DIRECTLY with the customer as this back and forth with PS only delays the solutions and is an extremely BAD experience for the customer, especially when we cannot help as in this situation
if you need access to the customers BAS you will have to provide your email address to them, and have them add you as far as I understand the situation, but since the issue ONLY occurs on the deployed cf site, that should be sufficient.
All the best

According to the attached "CHR Issue Console & HAR file.docx", the FE app fails to load due to the "Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'entityType')" in sap\suite\ui\generic\template\libavigation\startupParameterHelper.js.

Dear Arun,
thank you for your reply.
Based on the information you provided: "You are using SAP's own standard app router", we think you are using Managed .
If you are using Managed , the app will be available from HTML5 Content.
You cannot use Manual Integration of apps.
In this case the steps to consume the app in Launchpad are different, you have to use this: Run Applications in SAP Launchpad service | SAP Help Portal
You need to configure manifest.json as per Expose HTML5 Applications in SAP Launchpad service | SAP Help Portal
and then: HTML5 Apps Content Provider | SAP Help Portal To integrate apps and shell plugins from the HTML5 Apps content provider, you need to perform the 4 tasks that are mentioned in this link.
Please check that you followed the documents correctly and let me know the result.
Thank you. Kind regards,  SAP Product Support 2022-11-30 16:48:05 -  (I508887) (External Info)

Since customer's backend system is S4HANA, I've recommended customer to use odata service URL.
But now they faced the error Authentication incorrect though giving right password(see attached BAS Odata2.PNG)
Could you please help assist further regarding this issue? Best regards,  2023-03-08 05:13:52 -  (I552618) (External Info)
Dear , Thanks for the update.
We are using data source as "Connect to system" not "Connect to odata service". I am getting the error while using the option. please check first screen in my document BAS-error.doc. Is it right option to call backend service? let me know if I have to use "Connect tp Odata service" option only? As I replied before, it's mentioned in KBA 3063160 that If your backend system is S4HANA, please use a odata service URL instead of the catalog.

Regarding the new issue while using odata service URL, it is kind of our my knowledge.
As the KBA 3063160 - All catalog service requests failed for system: /. OData version(s): V2, V4. belongs to CA-UX-IDE team. Hence I'll reroute the incident to this team.

Hi , Thanks for your quick response.
Looks like the document is talking about destination with direct connection from BTP to backend system but in our case we are using cloud connector between BAS and backend system.
As mentioned in my last reply:
When generating an application ensure that the destination name is used in the service URL, n.b. the destination format (.dest): In your case, it should be https://Sd1200_AT2_CLONING.dest/sap/opu/odata/sap/xxx
I understand you are using cloud connector to connect to your backend system.
As you can see, the URL format in provided document does using the destination. "Sd1200_AT2_CLONING.dest" is your destination between Subaccount and backend system.
In BAS, it will recognize that Sd1200_AT2_CLONING.dest is a destination in your subaccount, and then it will point to backend system accordingly. Thanks and regards,  SAP Product Support 2023-03-08 02:17:35 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)

This incident is opened for the issue "All catalog service requests failed for system" regarding destination Sd1200_AT2_CLONING.
Could you please let us know is this issue got fixed by following the solution we provided before?
I can see the current destination with issue is Sd1100_AT2. This should be considered as a new issue.
In case the issue regarding the destination Sd1200_AT2_CLONING still exists, we will investigate further.

Hi ,

Initially reported issues are fixed/clarified, but there is follow up request/question, which is not related to Fiori Tools team.
Could you please check last comment from customer, there is link to comment in blogs.sap.com which refers to you - https://blogs.sap.com/2020/08/27/starting-workflow-from-custom-fiori-application-in-cloud-foundry/comment-page-1/#comment-549633
It looks like customer does not know how to go with 3rd step. Could you please help customer with such configuration?

We are working on a custom application which involves Document Management Service. The main issue is not able to run this application locally in BAS as we are getting not found error for Document Management Service. { "source": "^/api/(.*)$", "target": "$1", "authenticationType": "", "service": "com.sap.ecm.reuse", "endpoint": "ecmservice" } I have come accross this blog which mentioned the below steps to run application in BAS by binding the service locally to the app. https://blogs.sap.com/2020/08/27/starting-workflow-from-custom-fiori-application-in-cloud-foundry/comment-page-1/#comment-549633 here they have mentioned it for the Workflow service, the same thing We want it for the DMS service. Create run configuration as intended. Bind destinations and  if needed. SAP BAS > Cloud Foundry Targets > Find your worklow service instance. Right click "CF: bind a service to a locally run application" > Bind it to your ui module Open the created .env file and 'cut' the workflow object from VCAP_SERVICES. Take it basicly in your clipboard. After the cut .env file should look like this: VCAP_SERVICES={} Paste the content in .env1 (basicly to your run configuration env file) VCAP_SERVICES right after  (if you have it of course). You have make sure that the content is a valid json. With this manual addition in your .env1 file you can also call workflow APIs in the preview mode. But I dont see the .env1 file in the app So, I could not add the service details to that. Could you please help us to run this application locally. 2023-03-14 12:36:40 -  (C5205085) (External Info)
Dear Customer,

Could you please create separate ticket regarding error 'Some extensions were not fully installed. You can continue to work in SAP Business Application Studio and we will retry next time you restart the dev space.'? It should be investigated separately from reported launch configuration issue(s). Incident can be reported to BAS component 'CA-BAS-FWK-EXT'.
Regarding 'Configure Environment' issue - it is unsupported feature which accidentally was included in source code and released. In our upcoming fix - 'Configure Environment' option will be hidden and not available. If you would like to have support for 'Configure Environment' option, we are taking this as a feature request, please let us know if there is requirement for this feature.

Thanks for the update. Yes Issue1 and Issue2 were fixed. Only the Configure Environment issue which I am facing now and also I get this error everytime when  I open my workspace "Some extensions were not fully installed. You can continue to work in SAP Business Application Studio and we will retry next time you restart the dev space." I have checked restarting the work space but still face the same issue. 2023-03-13 13:34:13 -  (C5205085) (External Info)
Dear Customer,
We identified issue regarding 'Configure Environment' - issue is in application modeler extension and we are working on fix. Progress update will be posted here.
Could we please sumarize what issues are still actual? 1. I think we resolved issue under 'Issue2.png' by removing comments from 'launch.json'. Please correct if issue still exists; 2. 'Issue1.png' -> 'there are no runnable resources'. Is this issue still actual for you or it is resolved? If issue is actual, then could you please provide step-by-step scenario or screen recording?
3. 'Configure Environment' issue - issue is identified and we are working on fix.

Hello,

Issue regarding 'Configure Environment' - is on tool-suite side and application modeler.
We are wrongly consuming BAS API - https://github.wdf.sap.corp/ux-engineering/tools-suite/blob/master/packages/lib/launch-config/ide-extension/src/wing-run-config-integration/FioriConfHandler.ts#L61
Github issue for reference - https://github.wdf.sap.corp/ux-engineering/tools-suite/issues/24069

Best Regards
 2023-03-09 16:09:08 -  (C5205085) (Internal Info)
Hello Colleagues,
We fixed issue within regarding application modeler 'issue2.png' - reason was that 'launch.json' contained comments and run configuration webview does not support such syntax. Customer removed comments, but customer faced different error next, which does not relate to application modeler extension.
You can find full scenario in attached video 'IssueVideo.zip'. I also can reproduce such issue from scratch in BAS workspace - https://sap-ux-stage.cry10cf.int.applicationstudio.cloud.sap/index.html In sumary issue related to context menu button 'Configure Environment' in 'Run Configuration' view. Scenario: 1. Create run configuration for project; 2. Open 'Run Configuration' view; 3. Right click on run configuration; 4. Click on 'Configure Environment';
Problem - error appears: ``` Error running command runConfigurations.openEnvFile: cannot open vscode-remote://theia-workspaces-ws-kngxq.cry10.int.applicationstudio.cloud.sap/home/user/projects/core-documentmanagement. Detail: Unable to read file 'vscode-remote://theia-workspaces-ws-kngxq.cry10.int.applicationstudio.cloud.sap/home/user/projects/core-documentmanagement' (Error: Unable to read file 'vscode-remote://theia-workspaces-ws-kngxq.cry10.int.applicationstudio.cloud.sap/home/user/projects/core-documentmanagement' that is actually a directory). This is likely caused by the extension that contributes runConfigurations.openEnvFile. ```
Could please look into issue with 'Configure Environment'?

Dear Customer

Thank you for shared step-by-step scenario, we can reproduce issue locally. We processed issue with 'Configure Environment' error to SAP Business Application Studio team for next steps. Progress update will posted here.

Dear Customer,

thanks for attachments. I checked you application - it looks ok and we can not reproduce reported issue locally. We would like to ask some additional information to help identify issue: 1. Please send screenshot with left panel - file explorer of your opened workspace(when you face issue); 2. As such error is unknown for us, could you please create doc file or maybe screen recording with step by step scenario how to reproduce issue. If it is doc file with screenshots could you please provide step by step scenario? Please also include screenshot with error.

Thanks for the details. Yes, Issue2 was because of having comments in launch.json. I removed comments and able to create Run Config but I am getting new error when I try to configure envinorment.

Dear Customer

Could you please share your project and '.vscode/launch.json' file?
1. Issue2.png most likely happens because you have comments in 'launch.json'.
Could you please try to remove comments from 'launch.json' file and run your scenario again?
2. If first step does not solve issues, please share your application. For application share you can use `Application info:
2.1. Run `Fiori: Open Application Info`;
2.2. In opened `Application Info` view - check for `What you can do`;
2.3. Click on `Create Archive`;
3. If first step does not solve issues, please share also `.vscode/launch.json`;

Hi
Thanks for your quick reply.
I followed your instructions:
I ran 'npm run build' successfully.
Then, I ran 'npm run deploy'  - I got an error message -3008. (I think that this error relates only to the autcomplete that is not working in my offline system)
archive.zip was created but the zip is empty.
Attached files "npm run build", "npm run deploy", ui5.yaml", "ui5-deploy.yaml".
Best Regards,
 2023-03-06 11:06:01 -  (I515700) (External Info)
Dear Customer,
Please be advised the customTask added to the ui5.yaml is usually located in the ui5-deploy.yaml. This is generated when deployment configuration is added to the Fiori project. By removing the task from ui5-yaml and adding it to the ui5-deploy.yaml the `npm run build` task should run succesfully.
Once this is complete, please run `npm run deploy` as this will generate the archive.zip which is not currently being found when the deployment is attempted.
Regards
 Fiori Tools Team

Hi ,

We looked into your scenario of using servicee alias. Below I am listing down some steps which you will have to do at the time you generate your application.
Please have a look and let me know if you have any follow up questions. We can also get into a meeting if you have any questions regarding your set up.

Steps to use alias:
1. Generate application as normal pointing to real service e.g. `/sap/opu/odata/sap/SEPMRA_PROD_MAN/` 2. Check app loads in preview 3. Change the manifest.json to use the alias for the odata service e.g. `/sepmra_prod_man` also update the backend annotations service to set the `uri` and `localUri` to point to the annotations directory e.g. `annotations/SEPMRA_PROD_MAN_ANNO_MDL.xml` ``` "dataSources": { "mainService": { "uri": "/sepmra_prod_man", "type": "OData", "settings": { "annotations": [ "SEPMRA_PROD_MAN_ANNO_MDL", "annotation" ], "localUri": "localService/metadata.xml" } }, "SEPMRA_PROD_MAN_ANNO_MDL": { "uri": "annotations/SEPMRA_PROD_MAN_ANNO_MDL.xml", "type": "ODataAnnotation", "settings": { "localUri": "annotations/SEPMRA_PROD_MAN_ANNO_MDL.xml" } }, "annotation": { "type": "ODataAnnotation", "uri": "annotations/annotation.xml", "settings": { "localUri": "annotations/annotation.xml" } } ``` 4. Update the ui5.yaml to add a backend route for the alias used. Replace with your host/port placeholder below
``` backend: - path: /sap url: http(s)://host:port - path: /sepmra_prod_man url: http(s)://host:port ``` 5. Copy the backend annotations file from localservice direct to annotations. e.g. annotations/SEPMRA_PROD_MAN_ANNO_MDL.xml
6. Start the preview the app should load without logon.

Hi,
Standalone and managed approuter have very different setups where a managed approuter does not generate any additional folders, everything is self contained inside a single mta.yaml. Please refer to this git repo
https://github.com/SAP-samples/fiori-tools-samples/blob/main/cap/cap-fiori-mta/mta.yaml
Based on your attached documents, the mta.yaml generated will never have a managed approuter configuration added.
However, you have now added a standalone approuter, can you explain how this was added? Since this was added the following step can still be run to ensure your Fiori app has the appropiate routing configured to handle odata/ui5 requests;
Step1.
To update your Fiori Application to use the appropiate destinations, open a terminal window, ensure you are in the root of your Fiori App and run `npx fiori add deploy-config cf`. This will prompt for you the destination and will generate the xs-app.json for you to ensure the ui5 resources and odata services are loaded correctly
Again, the following file ensures your Fiori app has the appropiate routing configured when deployed to Cloud Foundry;
https://github.com/SAP-samples/fiori-tools-samples/blob/main/cap/cap-fiori-mta/app/feproject-ui/xs-app.json
Please refer to this blog to generate a Fiori App using a managed approuter configuration https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/appstudio-sapui5-create.html - in your flow, ensure you select a destination for the both the datasource and for the cloud foundry deployment step.
This blog gives more insight why managed approuter is a better approach

Hi , Actually, We have tried that option by selecting "Add application to Managed Application router" in creation wizard. But unfortunately, App router folder and relevant  files were not auto generated and after the deployment in BTP, The project was deployed under HTML view WorkCentre in BTP, not in app router WorkCentre. Since Managed App router was not generated, we have created a standalone App router and also we were able to see the project in App Router workcenter in BTP. please let us know if we missed some steps during creation time. Regards,  2022-03-29 09:04:43 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
Can I ask why you selected "No" for Add Application to Managed Application router? In order for the destinations to be consumed by your application you need an approuter type ie. standalone or managed. Since you have selected No to adding a managed approuter configuration, there is nothing managing the routing of the application when deployed to CF.
The reason it will work local in Business Application Studio is due to the ui5.yaml which is handling the mapping for the "resources/sap-ui-core.js".
The reason the absolute path of the ui5 is working is because there is a whitelist for that URL which means we dont require a destination to be present to support it. However, best practice is generate an instance based destination, if you look at the mta.yaml there is already one created for you. Again, your issue is that the mta.yaml has no routing configuration to handle this.
The soluton is to re-run your steps again, selecting yes to Add Application to Managed Application router or to run the Approuter Configuration generator from the command palette to append a managed approuter to your existing mta.yaml. You can then rebuild and redeploy to CF and everything should work.

Dear Colleagues,
The customer is having an issue with loading libraries when creating a freestyle UI5 project in BAS. The resources don’t appear to be available in the project. I got them to try with a lower version of SAPUI5 and it still did not work, and I cannot find any solution, so I am forwarding for review.
Full details, including a step by step guide can be found in the Summary section of the incident and in the attachments. The customer provided the URL to their BAS, but you will need to provide them with your details so that they can add you.

Hi,
The fix is as follows;
change your ManageSupplier controller to the following;

var oModel = new sap.ui.model.odata.v2.ODataModel("sap/opu/odata/dmo/API_TRAVEL_U_V2");

Where the first forward slash in the ODataModel is removed.

This will use the relative path rather than the absolute path.

Solution provided: Customer was using custom code that wasn't creating the datamodel correctly. 2021-09-27 12:49:34 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
The root cause has been idenitified as the controller code which is creating an odatamodel object that is not handling the host and app name correctly.
ie. the controller code is executing https:// /sap/opu/odata/sap/ZBL_SRV;v=2/ZBLSet/%metadata when it should be handling https:// /sap/opu/odata/sap/ZBL_SRV;v=2/ZBLSet/%metadata
Please refer to https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/topic/6c47b2b39db9404582994070ec3d57a2 for the params used to generate an odata model against a service URL.

Hi,
Just following up on the current status;
In my last email, dated Thurs 23rd Sept, asking to confirm a few items, especially around any possible firewall/filters etc that could be blocking the remote calls from CF since BAS and dynamic destinations are working.
If possible, please add my user id to your sub account and give access to SAP Business Application studio. User id *SAP-ID*, and email *EMAIL*. Once I've access to the same subaccount I should be able to validate the destination further.
Please let me know if you need to have a followup call today?

Hello @ (*SAP-ID*)
This is an escalated issue and I am frankly surprised by the approach and questions asked here to identify the issue to help the customer.
"Fiori team please check with the customer if my assumption is right" and thats something AFTER you had already proposed to the customer and passed on this ticket to CA-UX-IDE. The snapshot of project is not helpful either :-)
We are more than happy to help but please provide some good handover memo.

Note to escalation team: I will wait for customer to respond and can only provide further action items if I have the complete picture. To me it looks like misconfiguration in app router but at this point, this info was neither asked nor its there in the attachment. 2021-09-14 15:21:58 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hello, I have already changed my manifest.json with the aisapplication. I also wanted to ask why when I'm deploying the SAP Fiori app to Cloud Foundry under Space the application doesn't reflect on the space, but I can only see the deployed app under HTML5 Applications but when I clicked it there's no data displayed on the table. This is not only happens in prod, but also in dev when I deployed the app no data reflected. Please see also the attachment. Thank you! 2021-09-14 14:18:46 -  (I520232) (Internal Info)

Dear support,
This issue is not related to deploy to ABAP , the customer is deploying an mta application to cf.
it seems like the issue is with connectivity on runtime after the deployment,  the customer doesn't get data.
please check that the destination is configured properly.
in any way please don't assign this bug to CA-BAS-DPL since this component is related to deprecated abap deploy command.

Thanks,

Hi 

You should not have to create a new project using the wizard and copy your files across.  There is a migration tool as part of Fiori tools that you can use to migrate your existing Fiori application for use with BAS.  Full details are available at: https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_FIORI_tools/17d50220bcd848aa854c9c182d65b699/70d41f3ee29d453a90efab3ce025d450.html?locale=en-US

If you launch "View -> Find Command" and type "migrate", you should see an available command "Fiori: Migrate Project for use in Fiori tools".  This should launch a utility that detects any Fiori projects in your workspace that aren't migrated and allow you to migrate.

If your application is not detected by this tool as being available for migration, can you please zip up the project (without the node_modules folder) and attach it to this issue?

Regards,

Hi colleagues,
This customer was trying to use the abap-deploy command, but it was not working.
Upon checking with development, we were informed that the abap-deploy command was deprecated and not available anymore in BAS. The recommendation is to use https://help.sap.com/viewer/17d50220bcd848aa854c9c182d65b699/Latest/en-US/1b7a3be8d99c45aead90528ef472af37.html
However, the customer had to recreate the app in order for the deploy to work. See their latest message.
Can you advise? According to BAS dev, you are responsible for this area.

Hi ,
the following steps mentioned in the Help URL was not deploying changes to the on-premise S/4 system for the existing project folders. But, we had to recreate the project folder using the wizard again and copy the code changes in controller, view, formatter, external libraries referenced in the recreated project folders from the existing project folders manually. After making the changes, the application is working.

But this process takes time for each project to do,
Please give me a deployment solution for the Existing application in BAS.

Thanks & Regards,

Solution provided: Hello ,
I've checked this case with our development team.
The abap-deploy command was deprecated and not available anymore in BAS.
In order to deploy an application from Business Application Studio to ABAP system, our recommendation is to use deploy command specified here:

Hi , We have tried this and it works on the list page but not the object page. We already have the delete button exposed in the annotation and this is also something we will need to remove at some point. I still maintain that a call would be better to fully show our problem and understand how we ca fix it. So please let me know when you would be available this week.  2021-04-16 07:32:57 -  (I348261) (External Info)
Dear Customer,

Can you please try to add the below code in your manifest file under pages section
"pages": [{
"entitySet": "STTA_C_MP_Product",
"component": {
"name": "sap.suite.ui.generic.template.ListReport",
"list": true,
"settings": {
"gridTable": false,
"multiSelect": true,
"smartVariantManagement": true,
"variantManagementHidden": true
}
},
Also as our colleague mentioned you need to configure an action in the Request you to kindly try adding an action through annotation or enabling table Delete action .
In WebIDE d you might be able to enable it forcefully through UI adaptation, bypassing the above condition and manifest setting.
As there has been some changes done in WebIDE to FE tools i.e(business studio) you see the difference in behavior in both scenario .
Do try the above configuration and let us know if the issue still persists .

#TD_RO_09042021 2021-04-09 08:43:31 -  (D044415) (Internal Info)
Hi , the reason why it is working in WebIDE is because WebIDE Visual Editor writes flex changes directly on the control by-passing the FE template logic. It was the decision of FE to introduce the manifest switch and logic, the Fiori tools just follow FE dev guideline. Please explain that to the customer as this is not related to tools, but Fiori elements. I recommend to add this information to the documentation. Thanks and best regards,  2021-04-08 12:38:14 -  (I347413) (Internal Info)
Hi Colleagues, It looks, more than multi-select feature, customer is curious to know the why adaptation is achievable in web-ide but not in BAS.  From FE side we had clarified the functionality of multi-select. Could you please check this again and suggest customer. Please let us know if FE colleagues are required for any discussion with customer. Thanks & Regards:  2021-04-08 12:05:22 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi , Thanks for your response. I see you have acknowledged this works in Web IDE but not in BAS, is this not something that was planned to be moved over. I would like to schedule a call to go through this. What is your availability tomorrow/Monday?  2021-04-06 10:01:23 -  (I347413) (External Info)
Dear , Thanks for these words ! In general, The select option within Fiori Element table gets enabled if there is at least one action which requires selection of an entry. This action either could be one defined through annotation or standard button like "Delete". Such action would enable single selection by default and if application wants to change it to Multi-select then they could change with manifest property : "settings" : { "tableSettings": { "multiSelect": true } } Looking at the the shared screenshot, we could observe, there is no qualified action available in the table, therefore select option is not enabled. From webide you might be able to enable it forcefully through UI adaptation, bypassing the above condition and manifest setting. If the requirement is to enable the muliselect, Request you to kindly try adding an action through annotation or enabling table Delete action.  In that case the multi-select should get enabled without UI adaptation changes  in both the cases( Webide & BAS). I am not sure, if you are trying to achieve where, multi-select is required without any action. If so, please let us know the scenario details or your convenient time to schedule a call. Hope that helps. Thank You . Best regards:  2021-04-01 13:31:56 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)

#TD_RO_31032021 2021-03-31 07:55:15 -  (D044415) (Internal Info)
Hi colleagues, can you take over please. This is a Fiori elements issue. AFAIK the problem is that the new way of changing multiselect via manifest only works if there is a qualified action, but the old "brute force" way of changing the control via flex is doing it anyway, so the customer is confused. The documentation doesn't tell about this. Thanks and best regards,  2021-03-29 08:43:11 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi , Might it be easier for us to set up a call so that we can show you the issue?  2021-03-25 16:13:41 -  (D044415) (External Info)
Hi , thanks for the update, I was not able to reproduce, but now got the cause when looking again at the screenshot of your app. There is no multi-select enabled action defined on the table. The flag is correctly set, but Fiori elements only enables multi-select at runtime when there is at least one eligible action (e.g. delete). Can you confirm this by adding such action? (docu reference doesn't tell about that behaviour https://ui5.sap.com/#/topic/116b5d82e8c545e2a56e1b51b8b0a9bd) Thanks and best regards,  2021-03-23 14:13:14 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)

Hello Colleagues, Customer has not provided the sample application to check this behavior, however as per the below documentation of fiori elements, we expect multi select should be available without adaptation changes (just by configuring the manifest). https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/topic/116b5d82e8c545e2a56e1b51b8b0a9bd The reason we are transferring to Table component is to get an answer for customer query, where customer has mentioned table adaptation is not being allowed in Business application studio, can you please check this and update if that's a known limitation.

Hi ,
Thanks for the project. We have noticed that you are using "abap-deploy" for your project. please note that abap-deploy has been deprecated and for SAP Fiori projects, SAP Fiori tools is recommended for deployment.
To make it easier for you to understand and adapt your existing scripts, I would recommend the following:
1. Please create a dummy/temporary SAP Fiori project using SAP Fiori tools Fiori generator.
2. Either while generation or post generation, create deployment configurations.
Notice the scripts "build","deploy" and "deploy-config" in package.json. Then you will have a good reference for you to adapt your existing project.
You can find more information here: https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_FIORI_tools/17d50220bcd848aa854c9c182d65b699/1b7a3be8d99c45aead90528ef472af37.html
Please note that if you still have issue after following above instructions, let us know and we can help you take the next step. Again, please attach the modified project for us to have a look after you have changed your scripts.

Thanks,

Sorry ,

I should have been clearer.  Can you please do the following in BAS:

1. Select "View -> Find command" from the menu in BAS.
2. Choose "Fiori: Archive Project".
3. If you have more than 1 Fiori project in your workspace, it will ask you to choose one, otherwise it will automatically create a zip file of the project.

Please attach the zip file to this issue for inspection.

Hello , Can you please verify the Build file and let me know if anything causing the issue? The dist folder contains all the files, please find the attachment. Thanks,  2022-09-23 10:22:04 -  (D071761) (External Info)
Dear Customer,
deploying from Azure DevOps to S/4HANA on-prem is possible. It should work similar to any other deployment to S/4HANA on-prem.
We've looked at your attachments, and it seems like the zip file that you are trying to upload is empty. Uploading an empty file or archives is prohibited and therefore the deployment fails. The zip is probably empty because the build process is not working properly. In Deploy_Error.PNG line 20 the ui5 build command looks unexpected to me, as it uploads the content from a dist/uimodule subfolder. I would have assumed that you would need all of the contents of the dist folder. Could you please try and manually build your UI5 app and then check the contents of the dist folder? Does it contain all files as expected?
For further help and consultation I will forward your issue to product support.

Best regards
 UI Technology | SAPUI5 SAP Development Support 2022-09-23 10:21:47 -  (D071761) (Internal Info)
Dear Product Support colleagues,

please see communication to customer. It seems as the customer has a problem with his UI5 build, it probably produces an empty result that the customer is trying to upload. Some interesting point to investigate would be: Does manual deployment of the same project work for the customer? Does deployment from BAS work for the same project?

Could you please consult the customer. And if you need further development support, could you please make sure that the customer attaches the project they are trying to upload to the case?

Best regards

Hello , Thank you for your response. We are using Azure Pipelines to deploy SAPUI5 application from Azure DevOps to SAP On-Premise system. Please find the attached yaml file(Deploy_YAML.png) and let us know if we are missing any step related to ZIP. Thanks,  2022-09-08 12:44:00 -  (C5348377) (External Info)
Hello  ,
i suggest you use PKZip to compress the data then pass the file to the SAP system.
We are only able to handle the PK ZIP header ‘504B0304’ (see the check in method ‘LOAD’ (in CL_ABAP_ZIP), line 75):
WHILE offset < max_length AND zip+offset(4) = '504B0304'. " local file header signature.
please refer to me if you need anymore help.
Thanks

Hello colleagues,
This issue needs your attention. I found a few references with your component with these keywords: "CL_ABAP_ZIP", "504B0304"
Is there any reason on why this value '504B0304' hardcoded in LOAD method?

Hello,
We are implementing S/4HANA Cloud(ES) rel. 2105 and are trying to create a side-by-side app (UI5) in BTP and are calling the S/4HANA Cloud API endpoint in SAP Comm. Arrangement 'SAP_COM_0109' via this BTP app. We have setup the IAS trust between IAS & BTP subaccount and have created a BTP Destination using "Basic Authentication" where the uid/pwd is the Comm. User in S/4HC Comm. Arrangement (note, the comm system assigned to the comm. arrangement has the trust cert imported). We have run into an error on the BAS Studio when creating this app for SAP System and selecting this destination where the error is:
"OData version(s): V2, V4, Recommended service: , services unavailable from system: .
We have tried with the API URL as seen above above and even tried by going a little deeper into one API entity and still the error. We have added multiple properties in the destination with whatever little guides there are for BTP Cloud Foundry and we are getting a 200 connection test on BTP Cockpit for the destination, which seems ok. But, BAS Studio won't work and has the error above.
Attached to this case are some screenshots of the setup and steps we have followed. Please let us know how to address this issue.
Thanks for your help.
NOTE: This is NOT a S/4HANA Private Cloud scenario with SAP Cloud Connector, this is a pure SaaS S/4HANA Public Cloud system.

Dear Colleagues,
Could you please take over since the customer is facing the issue with communication scenario SAP_COM_0109. Please refer the attached document.
I have checked the back end and  com scenario has basic authentication as inbound authentication and host name also does not look correct.
So could you please take a look and advise.

Dear XX-S4C-OPR-INC Colleagues,
Could you please check this from your end?
BAS is sending the below request and probably gets back 401 error from S4Hana cloud although the customer provided the correct logon credentials:
https://my311819-api.s4hana.ondemand.com/sap/opu/odata/IWFND/CATALOGSERVICE;v=2/
Strangely, when called the same from browser it is returning 307 Temporary Redirect and the browser is able to download the XML for the catalog.
We also tested with curl command from BAS terminal and that also showed 307.
However BAS reports "Authentication incorrect!" which suggests that 401 was received from S4Hana Cloud.
Feel free to contact me directly if swarming is needed about this issue.
Thanks and Best Regards,

I noticed case #: 348771/2021 is also exhibiting the same errors for BAS w UI5 template in CF i.e. "Authentication incorrect!".

Solution provided: Dear Customer,
As far as I understood, you can access the backend system data while generating Fiori application in BAS.
I also do not see, why do you have to share the S/4HC Comm user and password for every developer and if yes, why is it a problem?
Could you please elaborate what is the problem with this method?
Since this is a different issue then originally reported, please close this incident and open another incident to avoid misunderstanding.
Best Regards,

,
Hi,
The “solution you have provided was already tried by us and that is not acceptable i.e. it is not a long term solution for app development with BTP-BAS because it exposes the S/4HC Comm user and password for every developer who develops apps in our company. This is not going to work and things need to be more secure without compromising the Comm. User password.
Please advise on how to resolve in a secure fashion and can we do a working session ASAP as this is becoming critical now?

Solution provided: Dear Customer,
Please note, that BAS tries to reach the following two URLs with a GET request and shows this error if 404 is returned:
/sap/opu/odata/IWFND/CATALOGSERVICE;v=2/
/sap/opu/odata4/iwfnd/config/default/iwfnd/catalog/0002/

Could you please test if a valid XML is returned on the following URLs in your case:
https://my311819-api.s4hana.ondemand.com/sap/opu/odata/sap/API_SALES_ORDER_SRV/sap/opu/odata/IWFND/CATALOGSERVICE;v=2/
https://my311819-api.s4hana.ondemand.com/sap/opu/odata/sap/API_SALES_ORDER_SRV/sap/opu/odata4/iwfnd/config/default/iwfnd/catalog/0002/

Business impact to date: S/4 HANA & Business Technology Platform (BTP) major go-live project. Go-live to production: August 1st. Go/no go: At this time there is a risk of a No-go for August 1st due this issue not being resolved yet. Issue is a showstopper for completing this part of project. Issue is a showstopper for go-live. Issue: Company are implementing S/4HANA Cloud(ES) rel. 2105 and need to create a side-by-side app (UI5) in BTP. They are calling the S/4 HANA Cloud API end-point in SAP Comm. Arrangement 'SAP_COM_0109' via this BTP app. Company have setup the IAS trust between IAS & BTP sub-account and have created a BTP Destination using "Basic Authentication" where the uid/pwd is the Comm. User in S/4HC Comm. Arrangement (note, the comm system assigned to the comm. arrangement has the trust cert imported). Have run into an error on the BAS Studio when creating this app for SAP System and selecting this destination. External consultants: Yes. The consultants working on this part of the project remain at a standstill (2 developers and 1 SAP consultant architect). Workaround: No, project team have tried with the API URL and even tried by going a little deeper into one API entity and still the error. Have also added multiple properties in the destination with whatever little guides there are for BTP Cloud Foundry and are getting a 200 connection test on BTP Cockpit for the destination, that seems ok. However, SAP Business Application Studio (BAS) will not work and has the error.

Hi,
I've reviewed your attachments and you are using the basic template flow with your own custom controllers; please review the following Guided Answers link to understand the changes required to change the service API call to using an absolute path;
https://ga.support.sap.com/dtp/viewer/index.html#/tree/3046/actions/45995:45996:50742:51205:51192:51195:51196:52513
The root cause of the 404 is the API is using the relative path which will not work when deployed to Cloud Foundry as your app is nested inside the HTML5 repository which will have a unique ID.
This should resolve your issue.

Hi,
I've reviewed your mta project and you have missed a step in the creation of your project. The mta.yaml has no router configured for example managed approuter or standalone approuter. When your UI5 app is deployed to Cloud Foundry, there is nothing handling the routing. Please refer to the following link for a sample of a valid mta.yaml using a managed approuter which is the preferred choice of approuter;
https://github.com/SAP-samples/fiori-tools-samples/tree/main/neo-migration/managedapp
Can you please refer to the tutorial or documentation you might have used to generate this application? If you  the mta.yaml before the UI was generated, please ensure append a rotuer type; you can use the 'Open CF Application Router Generator' which is a command palette option in VSCode and Business Application Studio to support you with this task.
Here is a deep dive into understanding managed approuter;
https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/appstudio-sapui5-create.html#5a114a0f-2e97-40cb-ba1c-8710e713a011
Please refer to the following links for more information; always ensure you have the mta.yaml configured with the type of router before appending UI applications as these are dependent on certain properties in the mta.yaml.
https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_FIORI_tools/17d50220bcd848aa854c9c182d65b699/2d8b1cb11f6541e5ab16f05461c64201.html
https://ga.support.sap.com/dtp/viewer/index.html#/tree/3046/actions/45995
There also a number of courses on the https://open.sap.com/ related to using Fiori Tools to generate Fiori UI applications with support for deployment to ABAP and CF.
Also, when generating a zip/tar you can drop your node_modules folder. The package-lock.json will allow you to regenerate the application to reflect the OS they are being installed on. Here is a typical command;
zip -r feproject.zip ./ / -x */\.* *.git \.* *.zip *.env* *.rb *.bak *.swp *.DS_Store *.back *.merge *.txt *.sh **/resources/\* **/mta-op-*/\* **/gen/\* **/node_modules/\* **/mta_archives/\* **/dist/\* **/.ABAPDeployResources/\* **/.vscode/\*
Replacing ./ / with the path to your project i.e. /home/user/projects/myproject for example.
In SAP Business Application Studio, open command palette via View -> Find Command and enter "Fiori: Open Environment Check" -> Select your specific project, this will also generate an appropiate sized archive for you.
Please let me know if you have any further questions.  2023-02-02 17:53:43 -  (I022947) (Internal Info)

Yes, it happens in newly deployed app. I undeployed it (using "npm run undeploy"), built the app anew (with "npm run build"), created a new mtar file (right-click on mta.yaml and selected "Build MTA Project") and deployed the app again ("npm run deploy"). Every action ended successfully. I still don't see the app in "HTML5 Applications" in my CF cockpit. 2023-02-01 15:18:56 -  (I022947) (External Info)
Does it happen in new deploy app?
I think the destination property can not be changed, you need to udeploy and delete destination service, and redeploy with the new value HTML5Runtime enabled 2023-02-01 07:58:57 -  (I035249) (Internal Info)
when checking the attached mtar file, it is clear that the parameter: HTML5Runtime_enabled has false value and not true.
So the check that does not works is not accurate.
Or the build of MTA turn this value from mta.yaml to false instead of true. 2023-02-01 07:13:27 -  (I530262) (External Info)

Dear colleagues,
Could you please help check the issue? Thank you so much.
Customer is deploying SAPUI5 application from BAS to CF Environment, the deployment is successful, but cannot see the application in BTP HTML5 Applications. For the details, kindly refer to the attachments.
And customer has maintained the parameter "HTML5Runtime_enabled" and set it to true in mta.yaml.  But the issue still persists. And ‘cf html5-list’ displayed the application.
Customer has attached the project to this incident. I can reproduce the issue in my BAS even if I have changed parameter "HTML5Runtime_enabled" to true.
We have run out of idea, could you please help check further?

Dear , I checked the note. Pictures are not available there, so it's hard to understand where exactly parameter "HTML5Runtime_enabled" should appear, but I do have it in my app (see sap-3.png attachment). I attach the mtar file as well (I couldn't attach a file with mtar extension so I changed it to txt. Please change it back to use it). This is not the real customer's app, but the problem is the same one. Thank you,  2023-01-30 02:28:40 -  (I530262) (Internal Info)

Dear Customer

Unfortunately currently we do not have option to downgrade application-modeler extension version in BAS environment. Next release will be available in coming weeks, but we can not provide precise date. We will provide an update to this incident when new version is released.
We can propose following options while new version is not released: 1. Use VSCode desktop with application-modeler version "1.8.5"; 2. Temporarily disable annotations which triggers issue with '"@sap/cds-compiler": "3.5.0"' - like commenting out '@Common.ValueList.entity' annotations which points to an entity with more than a single key or by commenting out second key in entity with multiple keys;
Also if it is acceptable for you, could you please attach your project to incident?

Hi, i don't know how to provide a stack trace inside VSCode for the Fiori Tools. Clicking on the error box doesn't provide any possibility so see more information. CSN is attached. The normal compilation doesn't create any error. Only Fiori Tools is throwing the error when I try to make use of them. It seems Fiori Tools was updated yesterday.

Hi ,
thanks for reporting this issue to us.
Unfortunately, out of the screen shots we can't see what's going wrong.
It would be great if you could provide us the stack trace inside VSCode (I think by clicking on the error box) and  your current model (as CSN is sufficient) which causes the error.
Lets take it from there.

Hi, 1. The error apears on . https://siemens-devops.eu10cf.applicationstudio.cloud.sap/index.html#ws-6wbn6 2. On BAS it is the "Full Stack Cloud Application Dev Space" , no additional extensions installed 3. I added an additional screenshot. I do a klick on the Fiori Tools (1) on the right, after that I do a double click on the project name (2). Then the error pops up. best regards,  2023-02-03 12:21:57 -  (I044540) (External Info)
Dear ,

In the Business Application Studio and in VSCode I could not reproduce the issue.
Could you provide some additional information:
1. Does the error happen in BAS or only in local VSCode? If it happens in BAS, what is the BAS URL?
2. Which BAS/ VSCode extensions are installed?
3. Could you capture some screenshots about the performed step " when I try to open Fiori Tools ". (I tried with SAP Fiori tools - application modeler.)

Best regards,

Hello , after removing the  Version from the ui5.yaml file this APP is running now.  Also need to remove some of the old elements from the App . Thank you. 2022-08-04 09:04:16 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hello  , We will discuss this solution with our team and try to implement  and upate you.  you 2022-07-13 16:15:20 -  (D022159) (External Info)
Hello , Thanks for sharing the whole project. What I could see is that the migration did take place. Then I could reproduce your problem with the preview (or run configuration). First exception I could see in the console was "sap is not defined". Not that this is due your very old UI5 version, I could find 1.38.41 in the ui5.yaml file. Although 1.38 is still in maintenance, I could not find 1.38.41 anymore in our version overview. Thus my first question is if you cannot update to  a higher 1.38 patch level. I tried with 1.38.57, then facing the next but different exception: sap.f is not defined. Concerning this, please refer to the restriction that we defined for Fiori tools with regards to older versions. You can find the important information at the end of this page: Currently, SAP Fiori tools support SAP Fiori elements and SAPUI5 freestyle projects with minimum SAPUI5 versions 1.65 or higher.
In case there’s a need to test an existing projects with a lower SAPUI5 version, the following workaround can be used to preview the application:

In the ui5.yaml file, manually set the SAPUI5 version to the needed one, such as 1.38.50. In the HTML files, manually remove the “sap.f” references as they aren’t available in 1.38.50. Additionally, update the theme data-sap-ui-theme="sap_fiori_3" to a theme supported by the required version, such as 1.38.50:
data-sap-ui-theme="sap_bluecrystal" So, would you please try to get to a higher patch level, the follow the instructions from our Fiori Tools FAQ page? Best regards,

Hello Mr. , I checked your attachments, it looks like your app ZBILLADJ_WATCHER was not migrated correctly. This I could directly see from the package.json that still comprised the former dependency from the WebIDE extension. Please follow the instructions from https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_FIORI_tools/bdf9573a206b492382cc747e731cf34b/70d41f3ee29d453a90efab3ce025d450.html?version=DEV Only after that, do an npm install. The Application Info Page (command: Fiori Application Info) then should show that everything is alright. Best regards,  2022-07-05 07:19:37 -  (I044540) (External Info)

Hi Colleagues,
Customer migrated the Web IDE application to Business Application Studio using the Fiori migration tool, see Fiori.png file.

Dear Customer,

Apologize for the delay, I was temporarily out of office.
In npm install the fsevents package notification can be ignored, it is an optional package that has no linux version, hence the warning happens.

The sap/f/library.js access fails with 404 HTTP code, please refer to the solution from SAP Note 2668226 - Error 404 for resource ./sap/f/library-preload.json under FLP@EP

Hi ,
Those invalid annotation references where throwing an unhandled exception which caused the migration to fail to load the projects properly.
I've committed a change to the tools to handle this better in future. It will be available in 2/3 weeks in the released version.

Hi , This has indeed solved the problem. Thank you for the solution. However, could you please clarify why it was a problem for all projects to migrate when the problem was only in one specific project? Basically, the migration command was not working for any project in this  even though the problem was only in one project. Shouldn't the migration run individually for every project? Waiting for clarification to close the OSS. Best regards,  2021-06-22 13:29:54 -  (I058153) (External Info)

As regards the error 500 when retrieving the metadata, I think if you resolve the malformed credentials issue, this should also resolve your issue. Are you able to review the service endpoints exposed by your CDS app? When you run the cds run command, the app will display the service endpoints. Are these returning the metadata correctly?
Can you also please review this blog post to ensure you havent missed anything in your setup?

Hi,
After reviewing your attachment, your issue relates to a missing destination.
The reason your application works in local preview mode is the ui5.yaml has a backend configuration pointing to a remote URL. In order to achieve the same when deployed to Cloud Foundry, you need to expose a destination in your SAP BTP cockpit with the appropiate permissions and then configure it using the xs-app.json. Here is a sample of a destination in a Fiori application;
https://github.com/SAP-samples/fiori-tools-samples/blob/main/cap/cap-fiori-mta/app/feproject-ui/xs-app.json
You can re-run the deployment command again by running the following command from the root of your Fiori application;
npm run deploy-config
Ensuring you select the appropiate destination for your application.
To understand more about destinations please refer to the following guide:
https://help.sap.com/viewer/0f69f8fb28ac4bf48d2b57b9637e81fa/2105.500/en-US/31876c06f99645f289d802f9c95fb62b.html
I hope this resolves your issue.

2022-08-29 17:37:44 -  (I022947) (Internal Info)
The customer chose the option of service URL and did bot add any destination.
Then the deployed application fail in remote run.
I assume since there is no destination in xs-app.json 2022-08-29 13:23:51 -  (D057914) (Internal Info)

Customer is having an issue when generating a List Report Object Page. When they create the project the VAN file with the annotations from ADT is not generated.
When they import the same service into webIDE the VAN file is automatically created.
Is this expected behavior? Should the van file be generated?

Hello, The URL is: https://cf-akerbp.eu10cf.applicationstudio.cloud.sap/ We have an additional subaccount which has exactly the same error so I suspect it's more general. As for the reproduction: it happens when you create a List Report + Object Page (at least) from the templates in BAS. You can manually add the annotations by modifying the manifest and reloading. For me this is not urgent as we have a workaround but more of tip to you that something is probably broken... if the same ODATA is imported to WebIDE it works just fine and it generates everything as it should.  2022-09-08 14:53:35 -  (I531230) (External Info)

when I used SAP web ide / web ide full stack these steps was very easy and automatic, Repository and CR were created via web ide, and not manually. can you help us complete the deploy of our app?
our final goal would be:
be capable of modifying existing standard app, be capable of modifying already existing custom deployed app, creating new custom application as we did in 2019. (it is quite important because the deployed app are now not maintainable)
thanks ,
kindly,

HI ,
Thanks for that. This gives me little bit more perspective in filtering out the possible causes.
At this point, it is very likely that you (user you are using) have enough authorization for your backend system you are are trying to deploy.
Background: SAP Fiori tools uses "/UI5/ABAP_REPOSITORY_SRV" OData service to load data to the SAPUI5 ABAP repository. To use this, the user needs " S_DEVELOP authorization"
Please see this documentation here: https://ui5.sap.com/#/topic/a883327a82ef4cc792f3c1e7b7a48de8
(Scroll down to "Note")
Can you please ensure that the user you are using to deploy has the right authorization please?
If you are still getting same issue, please revert back the message.

Best Regards,

Hello Mr. , First, let me state that CA-UX-IDE is the wrong address for your issue: CA-UX-IDE is relevant for design time during the app development at VSC or BAS, but not for run-time issues. Second, I must say that there is not enough information provided that could allow me to forward to the probably right component. In general, if the SAP UI5 component cannot be loaded, you should open the console. - First should check for connection issues of the http requests. - If connection is OK, check for console log entries. (Please add the relevant exceptions to this ticket) In most cases the problem is due to syntax or run-time errors of the backend, so the next hint would be checking if your (OData?) service works fine. If you finally detect it is an app problem, address to the app owner (is it an SAP app?) So please address to the relevant app's component (add the Fiori ID if it is a SAP app and you cannot find the component on your own). If it is a customer app but you think it is a problem of the framework, the next question is which framework you use. Is it based on Fiori Templates? Then you could address to component CA-UI5-ST*. In case of a free-style app based on SAP Fiori you should rather choose another CA-UI5* component, e.g. CA-UI5-COR. Best regards,

Hi ,
Sorry I thought it was a Fiori elements apps. Great that it works for you.

Thanks for the feedback,

2021-06-10 15:24:46 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
: Thanks for the code fix. FYI: The file that you reference doesn't exist in the webapp folder tree (see attached "Webapp Folder Tree.jpg"). However, I added the code snippet to the onInit() function in our controller extension, and it worked OK. Many thanks, D. 2021-06-09 16:54:44 -  (I058153) (External Info)
Solution provided: Hi , In the file ./webapp/locate-reuse-libs.js change the following:
Insert after
// Requiring the ComponentSupport module automatically executes the component initialisation for all declaratively defined components sap.ui.require(["sap/ui/core/ComponentSupport"]);

the following
// setting the app title with the i18n text sap.ui.getCore().attachInit(function () { jQuery.sap.require("jquery.sap.resources"); var sLocale = sap.ui.getCore().getConfiguration().getLanguage(); var oBundle = jQuery.sap.resources({ url: "i18n/i18n.properties", locale: sLocale, }); document.title = oBundle.getText("appTitle"); });

Save and preview the application using the index.html. Page title should be set.
Deploy app.

Hope this helps for your app.
We hope to include this fix in a future release of then Fiori generator.

Hi , Could you please verify if https://github.wdf.sap.corp/ux-engineering/tools-suite/pull/13828 will solve the symptom? 2021-06-07 07:21:18 -  (D022159) (Internal Info)

P.s. I have to correct: the {{appTitle}} syntax is also valid, the title should show up at run-time. the appTitle must be maintained in the i18n/i18nproperties file of the webapp folder and the file must be specified correctly as a resource in the manifest. You must also guarantee that the i18n file exists in the right language, corresponding to your browser language. If these prerequisites are fulfilled but the app title does not show up, please address to component CA-UI5-ST-LR. 2021-06-04 09:23:12 -  (D022159) (External Info)
Sorry, I have to correct myself: we just tested in our landscape and the {{appTitle}} syntax works fine here. The appTitle key must be present in in the i18n/i18n.properties file under webapp. If the title does not show up at tun-time, please address to the Fiori Elements component. CA-UI5-ST-LR. But before you should check your browser language in comparison with yout i18n files: is the i18n file also present in the right language? 2021-06-04 08:44:03 -  (D022159) (External Info)
Dear customer, the syntax {{appTitle}} was previously used in WebIDE but should not be used any longer in BAS. In WebIDE you got a pom.xml file, and the app title had to be defined there instead of  the 18n.properties. With the switch to BAS we also had a switch to npm, thus the pom.xml is not used anymore. Thus you should use the regular syntax for i18n properties {i18n> } to address i18n properties. Would you please try this? Best regards,   2021-06-02 10:01:04 -  (I079882) (Internal Info)
Hi Development Team,
Customer created Fiori Elements list page using BAS wizard for custom development. The i18n.properties file originated as part of the application. They could not see fiori tile displays {{appTitle}} instead of correct app name.  UI5 library version is 1.71.28.

Customer confirmed the translation files are set up correctly to use the App Title provided during wizard steps.

We could see the "appTitle" has been correctly defined, and its been referenced correctly in the "manifest.json" file. The text values in the file for the application title and name were actually put there by the Business Application Studio wizard. We subsequently added other texts to this generated file; all of the other texts are being displayed in the application as expected.

Connections are opened, connect via HTTP, you could reproduce the issue using below link
https://atldfgr.celanese.com:8240/sap/bc/ui2/flp/FioriLaunchpad.html#Shell-home
click on any tile and observe that in the web browser tab, there is {{appTitle}}
Could you please validate and assist customer on this.

: This is not an extension of an existing SAP application; it is completely new customer development. The current i18n.properties file originated as part of the application when it was created using the BAS wizard for a Fiori Elements list page. Although installed in the development environment, none of the standard SAP applications are being used at the moment. Regards, D. 2021-05-21 13:21:33 -  (I079882) (External Info)
Dear Customer,
 is on holidays, I'm assisting you with this incident.
As you have mentioned you have already checked the note 2364152, have you copied the ./webapp/i18n/i18n.properties file and directory from the original application to the extended application and redeployed the Fiori application, and tested it?
If you created a new i18n file, please remove your i18n new file and try with the standard, i.e, Copy the i18n.properties of the SAP standard application to the i18n directory of your extension project, OR Copy the entire i18n directory from the SAP standard application and paste it into the webapp folder of the new application, redeploy the app and see if its working?
If the issue still persists, please let me know this standard app or custom app. I could see you are having UIGRAC01 component installed on your system, are you using Check Request Status Fiori App as well?.
Thanks

Hi Team, Thanks for your response. We are following the deployment process as mentioned here - https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_CLOUD/0f69f8fb28ac4bf48d2b57b9637e81fa/31876c06f99645f289d802f9c95fb62b.html Without this, as it mentiones, app cannot be deployed to the ABAP UI5 repository in the SAP S/4HANA Cloud FLP. For this reason, we regenrate the ui5-deploy.yaml file with Fiori tools commands. However, it does not authenticate the user/password. Our question - Is then help documentation not correct or could it be something to do with IAS? Appreciate, you investigating the authentication issue. Regards 2022-07-19 15:09:00 -  (I830561) (External Info)
Dear customer,
The service called that requires authentication is not critical for deploy configuration. But unfortunately it blocks the process if credential is invalid. Since you already have ui5-deploy.yaml generated before, you can manually update the configuration in the ui5-deploy.yaml file in a text file editor.
Meanwhile we will investigate the authentication issue.

Solution provided: Dear ,

Thank you for contacting SAP Support! My name is  and I'm taking your query.
This is the expected behavior, the field "SAML Bearer Issuer" needs to be filled manually.
If you click on the blank field, you'll see that there's a red message "Please enter a name for the SAML Bearer Assertion Provider".
You need to upload the signing certificate of the trusted provider and define the provider name.

Please let me know if you still have any concerns that I'll be glad to help you.

Best regards,
,
SAP Support.

Dear Experts, I have finalized my adaptation of the timesheet fiori application. Unfortunately the deployment is not working. I am using the local cloud connector, my user has all the necessary permissions in the backend. The cloud connector has access to the repository /sap/bc/lrep/dta_folder/ and I was also able to deploy other fiori apps in the past. I have checked that no similar namespace for the app exists - through transaction SUI_SUPPORT. I tried to deploy the app through the template "deploy adaptation project" and I get a success message. But on the backend I don't see any objects in my transport request neither through SUI_SUPPORT - Report "/UIF/GET_FILES_4_NS". I attached screenshots, a video and a log. Please help. Thank you.

Yes that is correct, using the proxy settings from vscode is the only way for now. However I will discuss it with our products owners and architects to see if it is something for our features backlog.

Hello 
Thank you for the reply. Currently I have issues with setting up the connection, I have not tested during the runtime yet.(as I was not able to connect to the S/4) Unfortunately, the "--proxy-bypass-list " did not work. The command I used to run VS code is as follows: code --proxy-server="[ProxyIP:ProxyPort]" --proxy-bypass-list="[s/4IP:S/4Port]"In that case, can I assume that the only solution would be to setting the S/4 host as the Proxy in the VS code(Settings>Application>Proxy)?

Hi ,
I am afraid fiori generator does not have a proxy-bypass setting. Do you need this for the generation or at runtime when previewing an app?
Can you check these settings here? https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/network#_proxy-server-support

You can probably use the below when starting your vscode
--proxy-bypass-list=(|)[: ][;...]
If you want to bypass the proxy during runtime, please see https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sap/ux-ui5-tooling#providing-proxy-configuration where it details how you can set the noproxy npm variable to bypass the proxy.

Thanks

Dear SAP support I have an update on the issue. The issue seems to be on that the VS code is using the OS defualt parameters
http_proxy and https_proxy
which does not provide connect to the on-premise S/4. The Proxy bypass settings on the OS seems to be ignored. As a workaround, by setting the S/4 host as the Proxy in the VS code(Settings>Application>:Proxy) I was able to connect to the S/4, but the parameter has to be maintained when I need to connect to a different server. Can you let me know if there is a way to set a Proxy-bypass for the Fiori Application Generator? Best regards,  2022-11-16 16:36:57 -  (I335123) (External Info)

Hello ! Could you please perform following steps: Close the Fiori generator if already open.

Hi ,

Thanks for providing the zipped project. I've reviewed it and tested locally and in BAS, here are the steps I've done:
- unzip project and run 'npm install'
- run command 'npm run build:cf'
- run command 'npm run build:mta'
I dont get an error for any of these steps (once I am logged into CF). Can you please confirm the commands/steps you are trying that return the error in the attached work document? Perhaps the zip command you ran is removing some file that is causing an error. One thing we can try, the command palette command I gave before for archiving the project using Fiori tools had changed recently, to archive you can:
From SAP Business Application Studio, open command palette via View -> Find Command and enter "Fiori: Archive Project" -> Select your specific
This should zip the project without the node_modules and keep the rest of the project files. Could you try this zip method and attach the project and I will check this to if other files in the project are causing the error.

Also, we have steps documented here https://github.com/SAP-samples/fiori-tools-samples/tree/main/neo-migration for migration from Neo to CF. A suggestion, if possible, would be to start again and follow these as it documents all required steps for the migration process. This is will ensure the application is fully configured to be used with Fiori tools in BAS. Furthermore, from the Fiori tools side our Migration tool was recently updated with support for applications with no webapp folder, so your application from Neo should now prompt for migration using Fiori tools to simplify the changes required. The Fiori tools migration is included in the documentation in the repo above, specifically here as Option 1 https://github.com/SAP-samples/fiori-tools-samples/blob/main/neo-migration/Option1.md.
Lastly, there was also some missing config in your application regarding security roles that you have defined but not used, that document also shows how to maintain these in the xs-security.json and the xs-app.json.

Hi ,

To zip the project with only required files included, please try either of the following:
- (If you have used Fiori tools with your project e.g. migration, adding deploy config) From SAP Business Application Studio, open command palette via View -> Find Command and enter "Fiori: Open Environment Check" -> Select your specific project and attach the generated zip to this case.
- Run the following command, replacing ./ / with the path to the project
zip -r feproject.zip ./ / -x */\.* *.git \.* *.zip *.env* *.rb *.bak *.swp *.DS_Store *.back *.merge *.txt *.sh **/resources/\* **/mta-op-*/\* **/gen/\* **/node_modules/\* **/mta_archives/\* **/dist/\* **/.ABAPDeployResources/\* **/.vscode/\*

Thanks for reporting this problem to us. From the document attached I see there is a syntax error (unexpected operator
Additionally can you provide some additional information regarding the steps taken to get to this point:
- As mentioned the app contained no webapp folder, did you manually add this and other files required for BAS? Or did you use any of the Fiori tools to add files/config required to run in BAS and for deployment to cloud foundry? If manual, please summarise what files you have added/updated.
- If possible (and you cannot resolve the syntax error), could you zip and the add the project from Neo and also the project in the current state that you are trying to deploy to cloud foundry to this case for further investigation?

Kind regards,

Hi , Thank you for the solution. This is resolved now. 2023-03-21 00:43:23 -  (D045154) (External Info)
Dear Customer,
From the content of file ui5.yaml I can see, there are duplicated entries:
backend: - path: /sap url: https://my402116-api.s4hana.cloud.sap destination: MY402116 - path: /sap url: https://my402116-api.s4hana.cloud.sap destination: MY402116
While this should not be an issue, I propose to clean this up and keep only one entry for path /sap in the ui5.yaml config. If you are running in SAP Business Application Studio, you could also remove the url property and just keep destination.
Could you please try to start the preview from terminal with parameter --verbose set? Open a terminal and navigate to the application root, where the ui5.yaml and package.json is located, and execute command:
npm start --verbose
Another check you could perform is, whether destination MY402116 is available and configured properly. To do so, you can open command palette (menu "View" -> "Command Palette..") and enter "Fiori: Open Environment Check". This will allow you to select destination MY402116 run checks. If there are issues, please store the result zip archive and attach it to this message.

Kind regards,  SAP UX Engineering 2023-03-20 23:03:35 -  (I022947) (Internal Info)

Hi ,
I am sorry to see that you are having an issue with SAP Fiori tools Guided Development. I have read through the past communication with my other colleagues -- since there currently is not a statement of severe business impact and the system is labeled as a development system, I am changing the priority of this incident to Medium (per the guidelines in SAP Note 67739 - Priority of problem incidents). That said, I still want to help you as best as I can.
Based on the screenshot, it appears that you have SAP Fiori tools Guided Development installed. To get started troubleshooting, can you please confirm that you have tried the opening procedure mentioned in the documentation  linked to? 1. Open the command palette by pressing CTRL + Shift+ P
2. Typing `Guided Development`
3.  the Fiori: Open Guided Development command
If you are still experiencing the issue with the error message, I would be happy to help you troubleshoot further. Would you be able to send me a zipped version of your project with the node_modules folder removed? This can easily be done with the Fiori: Archive Project command in the command palette. Enter the command, press Enter, select your project, and it will create the zipped folder for you.

Thank you very much, I confirm that the workaround fixed the issue. 2022-11-25 14:12:19 -  (C5205085) (External Info)
Dear Customer

Thank you for attached project - we can reproduce issue and we are working on fix. Progress update will be posted here.

Workaround is:
1. Open terminal for your application root folder;
2. Run command `npm i @sap/*EMAIL*`;
3.  window;
4. Open `Page Map`

In result older version(1.71.72) of `@sap/ux-specification` dependency will be installed - reported issue does not appear with such version(issue appears with versions above 1.71.72).

Hello, I attached the archive. Validate Project and application info are OK Regards, 2022-11-23 19:01:35 -  (I031735) (External Info)
Hi ,
Thanks for the logs you've provided so far. It tells us what's going wrong but not why exactly.
Have you already run the `Fiori: Validate Project` command? Documentation: https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_FIORI_tools/17d50220bcd848aa854c9c182d65b699/6f3c737aa18c4181b1f0a343755f335e.html?q=archive%20project

Checking the application information could also help and performing some of the checks there could also help: https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_FIORI_tools/17d50220bcd848aa854c9c182d65b699/c3e0989caf6743a88a52df603f62a52a.html?q=archive%20project

As always, I'd like to remind you to make a backup of your project before making any changes (using `git` or any tool of your choosing).
If nothing works, can you please use the `Create Archive` functionality in the Application Info page and attach the file to this ticket?

Fiori tools team 2022-11-23 15:00:57 -  (I044540) (External Info)

When promted for the data source I choose to create a new ABAP On Premise System. After giving URL and client the Wizard stops with below exception. (screenshots are attached). I checked a thread with a similar issue https://answers.sap.com/questions/13480261/sap-fiori-tools-connect-to-on-premise-system.html but the https certificate seems to be accepted. curl command also shows no issues. On the ICM, we have SAML/2 authentication enabled. Only exception is the ADT service which is running on basic authenication. This works fine with WebIDE Personal Edition.

Please give it a try and let me know how it goes.
If you need any additional support on this topic, please do not hesitate to get in touch with me at *EMAIL* and we can have a quick call.

Hi , thanks for the answer! Yes, the list of services would be great. Currently we have it nly deactivated for the ADT service. Best regards  2021-11-29 23:38:27 -  (I829208) (External Info)
Hi ,
We surely intend to support SAML in VSCode in future. As you would understand, I cannot comment on "when".
Meanwhile, to answer your questions:
1. SAML need not be deactivated at root node. If you are open to disabling SAML for a few selected services, I can tell you the list. Is that something you can work with?
2. Thats correct. if you do not want to go via npm configurations, you can also make that as a user settings in VSCode.
Use command pallete, "Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)" and add a line in there.

"https-proxy": "http:// @proxy-server-url>:"

Regards,

2021-11-23 09:46:31 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi, just to confirm: - SAML needs to be deactivated on the root node of the target system ICM - The proxy (=Windows) user and password needs to be stored in the NPM configuration (which is stored unencrypted in the filesystem) In this case, VS Code will very likely not be an option for now. Can you tell me, if this is planned to change in future releases of the VS Code solution? Best regards  2021-11-22 13:13:07 -  (I057951) (External Info)
Hi ,
1. 'the particular URL'  means the system URL that you are using during the app-generation.
2. Also since you mentioned below that the npm proxy is returning null, If they are not returning the details of your Corporate proxy, then you will need to set them as follows (replacing the parameters below with your proxy details): npm config set proxy http:// @proxy-server-url>: and npm config set https-proxy http:// @proxy-server-url>: And then restart VSCode. Please see https://medium.com/@ogbemudiatimothy/using-npm-install-behind-a-corporate-proxy-server-db150c128899 for an example on how to do this.

Can you please try above and get back to us. We will also have domain experts look into this.
Regards,
 2021-11-22 06:57:39 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi Fiori Tools Team, sorry, but somehow I missed your fast reply. You asked what happens when I try to reach "the particular URL". WHich URL do you mean? In general, SAML2 is active for the complete System. The only exception is the ADT Service which we also use for the WebIDE personal Edition. Which URL is needed to setup the system in this wizard? We could exclude more services from the SAML authentication. Best regards  2021-11-12 09:00:33 -  (D040068) (External Info)
Hello ,

When you test with curl or if you try to reach the particular url in browser, will you be able to login using basic authentication? Thank you.

Best Regards,
The Fiori tools team 2021-11-12 07:36:12 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi, additional input:
- On another customer site where it works I saw that the fields for user/password appear immediately after entering the system URL.
This is not the case here. I see the System-URL and the Client but nothing else. - When testing our hostname with curl I´m forwarded to the configured SAML IP. As written in the beginning the only path with basic auth is the /sap/bc/adt. Best regards  2021-11-09 09:19:03 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi Fiori Tools Team,
here the required information:

1. Version of the extensions you are using
Application Wizard v1.7.3
SAP Fiori tools - Application Modeler v1.4.0
SAP Fiori tools - Extension Pack v1.4.0
SAP Fiori tools - Guided Development v1.4.0
SAP Fiori tools - Service Modeler v1.4.0
SAP Fiori tools - XML Annotation Language Server v1.4.0

2. Operating Sytem (Windows or Mac)
Win 10

3. Proxy is NOT set:
npm config get proxy
null
npm config get https-proxy
null

But there is no proxy in place and the connectivity seems to work fine:

npm notice PING https://registry.npmjs.org
npm notice PONG 0.514ms

Also npm info ... giving reasonable feedback about modules
I know this issue from other customer sites and in case of a missing proxy npm is very "unhappy"

4. Uninstall/Install of @sap/generator-fiori worked fine but didn´t change anything on the error when connecting to a system

Best regards
 2021-11-02 18:43:07 -  (D040068) (External Info)
Dear Customer,

Thank you for the provided case. Do you mind if I asked you to provide us with some more details like following:
Version of the extensions you are using Operating Sytem (Windows or Mac)

In the meanwhile, could you please try the following from the command line:
npm config get proxy and npm config get https-proxy If they are not returning the details of your corporate proxy, then you will need to set them as follows (replacing the parameters below with your proxy details): npm config set proxy http:// @proxy-server-url>: and npm config set https-proxy http:// @proxy-server-url>: And then restart VSCode. Please see https://medium.com/@ogbemudiatimothy/using-npm-install-behind-a-corporate-proxy-server-db150c128899 for an example on how to do this.
These steps solved similar issue with the application generation in VSCode.

You can also try to uninstall and install the latest "@sap/generator-fiori" generator:
npm uninstall @sap/generator-fiori npm install -g @sap/generator-fiori@latest

Please let us know if this helped. Thank you.

Thanks for the response.

We have installed the version of @sap/ux-ui5-tooling

We would recommend to schedule a call to take the issue to closure ASAP, as we are not able to support the client with the development and production activities.

Thank you for contacting SAP Product Support. My name is  and I will be helping you with this issue.
I found an internal document that is not yet released, but the solution in the document says:
The version of "@sap/ux-ui5-tooling" package has to be updated in the application. To do it execute the command:
"Fiori: Open Application Info"
then click on the action to update @sap/ux-ui5-tooling.

Dear customer,

Thanks for reporting this issue to us and providing detailed information. I've reviewed the attachments and have some comments:
- can you confirm what you are trying to access here, is it an odata service or a service catalog? The destination is configured as a catalog (as indicated by the environment check you attached) so this will cause issues if not desired.
- if it is an odata service, please following the Guided answers here to configure it as a full/partial url:

Hi Team,

We want to to use SAPBTP platform.

We have installed SAP SCC 2.15.0 and also connected to Azure cloud with trial user id and password.

We were able to connect to SAPBTP from SCC as well as cloud to on premise Fiori system.

But when we are trying to access the service from BAS we are facing the below error.

Services Unavailable
All catalog service request failed  for system.

Please find the attached file as given in the screen and suggest the needful.

Hi,
This is expected behaviour where the protocol in the URL address of your SAP BTP destination will always revert back to HTTP. SAP BTP will initiate a secure tunnel between SAP BTP and your SAP Cloud Connector (SAPCC) using the URL address to look up the virtual host mappings defined in your SAP CC. Once this secure tunnel is created, in turn, it will determine if the outbound call to the internal host mapping is over HTTP or HTTPS. However, the first connection between SAP BTP and SAP CC will always be secure.
Please refer to the following guided answers for more steps to address your issue.

Hi ,

I just tested this again and it was working for me.
Can check that the this path exists "./node_modules/face-api.js/dist"?
If it doesn't exist, then check that the face-api.js dependency is maintained in the package.json and run "npm install" command. Dependency fragment should look something like this:

"ui5": {
"dependencies": [
"@sap/ux-ui5-tooling",
"face-api.js"
]
},
"dependencies": {
"face-api.js": "^0.22.2"
}

If this doesn't solve the issue, then would it be possible for you to attach your project here, so we can take a look and check if there is something else that we overlooked.

Hello  thank you for the hints. That already helps to get a whole picture. I added the lines to ui5.yaml but this error comes in the console
Error Message: root path required Please check the screenshot. Thanks and regards  2021-04-28 11:10:52 -  (C5226337) (External Info)
Solution provided: Hi ,

We were able to identify the issue with running the application using "npm start". It tries to load all the resources from https://ui5.sap.com including third party modules, because the UI5 configuration requires them to be under resources folder (which is fine in deployment, because they are getting merged together in the same folder). This is not an issue with start-local, because everything under resources is served from local files (similar to the deployment scenario). To fix the issue you can use static middleware (https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sap/ux-ui5-tooling#example-configuration-for-serving-any-resources-locally) in the ui5.yaml file to map these requests to correct files in the development environment. Based on your provided screenshots, this is the static middleware configuration that you should add after "fiori-tools-proxy":

- name: fiori-tools-servestatic
beforeMiddleware: fiori-tools-proxy
configuration:
paths:
- path: '/resources/face-api'
src: './node_modules/face-api.js/dist'

This will make sure that requests for face-api library gets intercepted and files from node modules are loaded instead of trying to load resources from ui5.sap.com.

In case you face any other issues don't hesitate to get back to us.

Hi ,
From the problem description I understood, that the application is working as expected (with 3rd party library) in the deployed version, however you are not able to run it locally. In your project folder you should see "ui5.yaml" and "ui5-local.yaml" files. I can see that you have maintained the configuration in the "ui5.yaml" file, which is used for deployment. Please check and make sure that it is also maintained in "ui5-local.yaml" file, since it is used when "npm run start-local" command is used.

I followed https://blogs.sap.com/2020/07/30/project-shims-using-npm-modules-with-ui5/ using latest version of SAP Fiori Tools to add moment library from npm to a UI5 application and was able to run it in the SAP Business Application Studio with "npm run start-local" command. However, when I tried to use "npm start" it failed, even though running "npm build" seemed to build application as expected. I'll continue to investigate this issue and reach out to the domain experts. I also noticed that you have "resources" folder in your "webapp" folder. It should not be necessary and UI5 tooling should take care of consuming npm modules, when you have maintained them in package.json and ui5.yaml (ui5-local.yaml) files.
For example, package.json dependency fragment could look like this:
...
"ui5": {
"dependencies": [
"@sap/ux-ui5-tooling",
"face-api.js"
]
},
"dependencies": {
"face-api.js": "0.22.2"
}

...

Hi,
During our call we are able to tweak the destination to support full_url destination. The application deployed now retrieves the service using the metadata call.
For future reference, please ensure the deployed app xs-app.json contains the following source and target, specific only to the route pointing to your destination
```
"source": "^/ /.*/(.*)$,"target": "/$1",
```
More info on  https://blogs.sap.com/2020/10/02/serverless-sap-fiori-apps-in-sap-cloud-platform/ which is the preferred way to managed your applications. Standalone is still supported but unless you have a very specific technical/business reason,  is the way forward.

We can disuccs this on the call. Can you please ensure there is a developer familiar with setting up destinations/service catalogs as they will need to confirm settings.

Hi, As suggested to validate the Destination configuration ->I have selected the Service Center there my choosen destination was already there as a file I can see the System Properties, will attach the screenshot of it. Attachment Name: "Service Center" ->I tried the cmd as you have given : curl "$H2O_URL/destinations/sap_hcmcloud_core_data/sap/opu/odata/IWFND/CATALOGSERVICE;v=2/ServiceCollection" Please go through with attachment for cmd o/p Attachment Name: "Cmd inTerminal" Regards,  2021-07-07 16:00:32 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi, Can you please check out the Attachment for destination configuration on BTP Cockpit   named as below: Attachment Name: "Destination in BTP" -->Our OData API Service doesn't have the "sap/opu/odata" ,  the complete service URL of us will look as below:
https://apisalesdemo2.successfactors.eu/odata/v2/FODivision?$format=json
--> When I connect with "Connect to an SAP System" it is showing Services are unavailable so couldn't complete the wizard to create an application. So created with the "Connect to an OData Service" then I given the Credentials for the Service created an application in BAS. The main problem was after deploying the app when try to run the app from "HTML5 Applications" metadata was not getting loaded. Regards  2021-07-07 14:47:23 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
The command is
curl "$H2O_URL/destinations/sap_hcmcloud_core_data/sap/opu/odata/IWFND/CATALOGSERVICE;v=2/ServiceCollection"
Which will invoke the service call against your destination.
The first api call just returns a list of destinations available for you to call.
If possible, can you please include a screenshot of your destination configuration on BTP Cockpit?
Another way to validate your destination configuration is to select Service Centre which is a new tab on SBAS, located on the left side bar. Select your destinaion and if configured correctly will return system properties.
For more info https://help.sap.com/viewer/17d50220bcd848aa854c9c182d65b699/Latest/en-US/99061814ead548808d539861fb27bafb.html
Please refer to `Connect to an SAP system using SAP Business Application Studio` as it explains the difference between a catalog serivce and service URL destination.

Hi,
Sorry, I misread your previous post that you couldnt load the new FE application which had the wrong pathname i.e. `cpp` instead of `launchpad`.
To validate if your destination is working, try these commands from a new terminal window in SBAS;
1. curl $H2O_URL/api/listDestinations
2. curl "$H2O_URL/destinations/ /sap/opu/odata/IWFND/CATALOGSERVICE;v=2/ServiceCollection"
The first call will retrieve all the destinations available to your environment. The second one requires that you replace the with your chosen destination and its exposing a V2 service catalog. I'm making the assunmpation that you are trying to retreive v2 services. More infor for the different datasources supported;

Can you please confirm the output for the second command, to retreive the catalog services?

Hi, I tried by replacing cpp with "launchpad" but still I am not able to load the metadata. Even I tried to access the app from HTML5 Application also but still same issue metadata is not getting loaded. -->There may be issue with Success Factors Destination. -->But I get the Destination Status as established in Connectivity in BTP but after deployment to CF the metadata is not getting loaded. My Xs-app.json: {       "source": "^/odata/(.*)$", "target": "/odata/$1", "destination":"sap_hcmcloud_core_odata", "authenticationType": "xsuaa", "csrfProtection": false } Need to contact through call to validate the destination. Regards  2021-07-07 09:30:06 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
In `Executed Command in Terminal`, can you try replacing `cpp` with `launchpad` in the URL. There is an known issue with the CF command showing the portal service endpoint rather than the launchpad endpoint https://github.com/SAP/cf-html5-apps-repo-cli-plugin/issues/42.
Otherwise, you can login to your BTP Cockpit and select HTML5 Applications and load your app from there.

Hi, Thanks for the response. Created a new Application using SAP UI5 Freestyle  Template not with Fiori Elements because we want different UI instead of Existing Floorplans available. https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/appstudio-sapui5-create.html#5a114a0f-2e97-40cb-ba1c-8710e713a011 By Following the above link deployed the app to CF but when I run the application, services are not getting loaded. Will attach the Screenshots when I inspect>Network Tab metadata is showing 404. Please let me know to go through the call to validate the destination is working or not. Regards,  2021-07-06 14:22:35 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
Here is a tutorial showing the creation of a SAPUI5 App using none as the destination. In your situation, you need to select the exposed destination in order to call the backend services;
https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/appstudio-sapui5-create.html#5a114a0f-2e97-40cb-ba1c-8710e713a011
If you open your xs-app.json in the root of your application, it will contain a route to your destination. When the app is loaded on CF, it will forward all data source requests to the destination.
Please confirm what destination is exposed in your xs-app.json? i.e.
`{

"source": "^/sap/(.*)$",
"target": "/sap/$1",
"destination": "testdestination",
"authenticationType": "xsuaa",
"csrfProtection": false
},
`
Here are few links that might give you a better understanding;

Hi, yes understood the Issue with UI while creating App will go through the terminal. Thank you Regards  2021-07-06 13:32:10 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hello, My First question was after deploying the Application where should the app will reside in SAP BTP either in Dev Space or in "HTML5 Applications". Our Requirement is to extend the UI5 application with Success Factors. Using  Deployed the app and opened the URL only the view part was loaded the Success Factor API Service was not getting called. Will attach the HTML5 Application Screenshot. Regards,  2021-07-06 13:31:37 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
Yes, this is a known issue that creating an FE app with no destination is forcing the destinations list to be empty. This should be fixed this week as we are releasing our latest updates.
You have the option of creating an FE app using the command line as well i.e. open a new terminal and type in `yo`, then select `Sap/Fiori`, this will bring you through the same setup but will allow you to select a destination during the deployment phase.
 2021-07-06 13:19:53 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi, Destinations are not getting loaded in BAS while creating Application. Regards,  2021-07-06 13:07:24 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,

I dont understand your first question? Can you please elaborate?
As regards, the destination not being listed, this is a known issue that is being fixed with our latest release due this week.
You can also run the wizard from the command line i.e. open a new terminal and type in yo selecting Fiori as the template generator. This will allow you to create a FE app without using the UI.
Please let me know how you get on.

Hi,
Thank you for your response, can I confirm why you choose a standalone ?
Have you tried to create a Fiori Elements (FE) application using a ?
Open the command palette `View` -> `Find Command` -> `Fiori: Open Application Generator`
a. Create a `SAP Fiori application`
b. Module name: uniquemodulename (make sure its unique in your organisation)
c. Namespace: com.hostname / leave blank if not applicable
d.  Select `Yes` to `Add deployment configuration`, refer to next step for more options
On the Deployment Configuration page, select `Cloud Foundry` as your target
a. Ensure the correct destination is chosen
b. Accept the default option to `Add application to managed application router?`
Build and deploy your app to CF;
npm run build:mta
npm run deploy
Unless you have specific reasons for using standalone, I would suggest using a  approach.

Hi, Had created a sap freestyle Application using OData Service URL& destination Proxy Type was "Internet"   and  not an Fiori Elements App. After generating mta_archive folder and deployed the Application to CF Dev Space. yes When the app is deployed and run in CF getting an internal server error. Actually I have two xs-app.json files in Overall Application : 1) In Cloudclone Fiori WebApp Folder 2)In Cloudclone- Folder In which xs-app.json file have to add the routes to handle HTTP requests? xs-app.json files are attached as asked. Please check the recent attachments. Need Help to handle routing Request and settings part in xs-app.json file. Regards,  2021-07-05 15:21:07 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
Just to be clear on the issue, you created an Fiori Elements app using an OData Service URL? Then added the deployment configuration? When the app is deployed and run in CF you are getting an internal server error?
Can you attach your sample project, removing all node_modules and mta_archived folders please and I can take a look?
The xs-app.json contains configuration in order to handle routing of HTTP requests, but I can take a look at your settings when you attach them.
Thanks.

Hi , I got packages *EMAIL*. And able to move to next steps. However, I get an error - Error: connect ECONNREFUSED 169.86.46.160:80 at TCPConnectWrap.afterConnect [as oncomplete] (node:net:1278:16) I think this is related to proxy. I have attached screenshot when I execute start command. Could you please help here. Thanks & Regards,  2023-01-30 13:35:09 -  (D062812) (External Info)
Hello ,
thank you for attaching the project. I was able to find the root cause of the issue. The issue is comes from the fact that the packages "@ui5/cli" and "@sap/ux-ui5-tooling" have dependency to different versions of the "xdg-basedir" package.
@ui5/cli --> update-notifier --> *EMAIL* --> *EMAIL*
@sap/ux-ui5-tooling --> update-notifier-cjs --> *EMAIL* --> *EMAIL*
Based on the "package-lock.json" of your application I can see that you have your own copy of the npmjs repository. I assume that in your npm repository, you only have "*EMAIL*", correct? But in this case we also need to have "*EMAIL*", because other packages have it as a dependency. And also because there were breaking changes, between version 4 and version 5 of "xdg-basedir".
So is it possible to include also "*EMAIL*" in your npm repository? If yes, this will solve the issue.

Dear customer,
Thanks for running the test command and returned back the output. The output adt_discovery.xml file looks correct to me this time. The discovery scheme shows you do have the ADT service available for fetching list of available transport requests.
Since the console log only indicates "Transport Request list cannot be fetched. Please enter Transport Request manually." without backend error message. It is likely the package name doesn't have any transport number associated with it. Can you check if the package name you provided does have transport number associated with it? If there is no transport number available, you can also get the message "Transport Request list cannot be fetched. Please enter Transport Request manually.". The other option you can try is to "Create New" instead of "Choose from existing". It will create a new transport number if the package name is valid.

Dear , Thank you very much for your prompt reaction and suggestion!
Unfortunately, the solutions you suggested did not help. We have already tested with a new dev space and new project.

The problem is, that it is a dependency within @sap/ui5-tooling. So we have no influence on it. We have learned from our service provider NTT DATA that this problem exists with numerous SAP customers, so we suspect that the bug would need to be fixed by SAP.

Please find a bit more detailed screenshot in attachments. Best regards  2023-01-18 16:37:16 -  (I320514) (External Info)

Thank you for contacting SAP Support.

Please try following the Resolution from this StackOverflow post and let me know how you get on:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36471096/npm-install-doesnt-work-no-errors-but-npm-install-package-does
Rename/remove your package.json file.
Create a new package file by running:

Option B: Install the packages and use --save to add the packages to the package.json file.
Run npm install to install the dependencies.
Make sure not to remove your package.json file until you have made a copy of it!
Alternatively, you could make a new DevSpace and then download your project from the problem space and import it into the new one. npm i should work then.
If the issue persists, please run npm audit (without 'fix') as per the message, does this list the package NPM has an issue with?

Dear SAP, I managed to solve the problem. There was a BusyIndicator function call in App View. 2022-09-28 10:45:40 -  (I012956) (External Info)
Hi ,
Your reply is in Portuguese so I've used some of our tools to translate this, hopefully correctly.
I've checked the steps you have taken, the only thing that stands out is that in Step 2 you only moved the manifest.json into the webapp folder before migration. I would recommend to move all files as I suggested previously as part of Step 2, as some of these files can be updated during migration and we will look for them in webapp. Perhaps test the flow again like this if possible as there might be a change to a file that was missed.
The project zip you provided looks to be only the contents of the webapp folder, so I cant try to start the app as the files outside webapp are needed to start it. You can easily provide a zip of the project by using the command from the command palette: 'Fiori: Archive Project'. What would also be helpful is if you could provide a screenshot of the busy indicator you see and also the browser console logs to show if there are any errors causing the busy indicator.
We can set up a call to go through these steps if needed.
Kind regards,

The Fiori tools team. 2022-09-27 14:57:28 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)

Hi,
I have reviewed the project that you attached and when I moved the required files into a webapp folder and migrate it I dont get the same error as in the screenshot attached. You mention you moved the manifest.json into the webapp folder, did you move any other files in the project into the webapp? Almost all files should be moved into the webapp, except the '.che' folder and the neo-app.json file. I've attached a screenshot of the correct folder structure before migration for reference.
Can you please try migrate the project with this folder structure and test again to see if it works.
Note: I don't have access to the backend service used by this app, so in my tests I used another odata service for the migration flow. The app doesn't fully load, but it gets to a screen where the is loaded behind a modal so this indicates that the app is generally working.

I managed to migrate the application by placing the manifest.json file inside the webapp folder. But the application gives an error when running. The error is in the attached image. I also attached the project that was downloaded from the webide as requested. 2022-09-20 10:34:10 -  (I305274) (External Info)
Hello customer,

One more thing you could perhaps try with your project (I'm assuming it has been downloaded from an SAPUI5 ABAP repository):

- Create a package.json and add a name property with the same value as the app id in the manifest.json file.
- Move the downloaded files into a webapp folder underneath the package.json
- Run the migration tool to migrate your project.

If neither of these options works, please include your project into the support case for us to investigate.

Best regards,

Hello customer,

Can you please detail how you developed this Fiori application?  Did you download it from an SAPUI5 ABAP repository?  In that case, it won't have the relevant folder structure that includes a webapp folder, and isn't supported for automatic migration.

Please see https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_FIORI_tools/17d50220bcd848aa854c9c182d65b699/ab4657ca9bd84cd6869a750a1d94b5bd.html?locale=en-US for details on how to import a project from an SAPUI5 ABAP respository to support Fiori tools.

Regards,

I can also see that the incident has been on Customer Actions status since the 17th of June. Therefore, considering that the incident is back on track, it seems that CIM engagement is no longer necessary.

Hi , We have two destinations - SAP Frontend Dev Server 'FED' client 202 and 222.Both the clients(destinations) come up with same response that it stalls for 5 minutes the first time. The project is in my dev space and executing the project from my BAS dev space and is not the deployed project that is having this problem.When deployed to cloud launch pad service,the application works fine but only when you run from BAS that it takes 5 minutes for ODATA to return a response. The two destinations configured are FED_202 and FED_222.Screenshots attached. All projects in BAS are having this issue and not specific to any particular. The simplest of projects that you create to make  an ODATA service call to the backend has this problem. You can send me a teams meeting invite or if you can share your email ID,I can set up a meeting to walk you through. My mail id is *EMAIL*. Would much appreciate if we can connect over a call as you have suggested as clarifying any of your queries would be easier. Thanks  2021-06-16 09:59:46 -  (I339272) (External Info)
Dear Customer

in addition, we would like to know if it possible to have a meeting to to resolve the issue ASAP

Hello BAS colleagues,
As the customer stated, the issue occurs only when the application runs in BAS (takes about 5minutes to load). A direct OData call retrievs the data in few seconds. As stated earlier, colleagues from OPU-GW-COR already checked that no issue from the OData side was found. That's why I'm forwarding to BAS component, please dispatch if an incorrect one chosen. Thank you.

Hi colleagues,
This is not a build issue but when running the application it takes time to load application data.
There's an issue is with the first $batch call when the customer reloads or refresh the screen. SAP BAS is stalling the call for 5 minutes and then it releases it to the Gateway. OData Service is working fine.

Dear colleagues,
Could please check and analyze this issue from BAS perspective?
I believe that issue is related to processing time in the Odata side, but colleagues from OPU-GW-COR already checked and said that no issue was found.
I was not able to find issues in BAS side to lead to this behavior.

Hi,
So you have completed the initial step, to create a root mta.yaml. This is a requirement before creating your adaptation project, based on the steps shown here
https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP%20Business%20Application%20Studio/584e0bcbfd4a4aff91c815cefa0bce2d/019b0c38a6b043d1a66b11d992eed290.html
A root mta.yaml needs to be created before the adaptation project is appended.
In theory, if you have an existing adoption project, you can re-use the generated mta.yaml configuration and folder already created and just copy over your existing adaptation project. Then follow the steps in the referenced link to append it to the mta.yaml and deploy it.
Does this answer your question?

Hi , Yes, I'm looking for solution deploy Adaptation Project that refer to ABAP but deploy to BTP CF. But when I'm create project Adaptation Project that refer to ABAP, there's no wizard to generate mta.yml After follow your step (Step1. and Step2.) (Record vid in attach 2022-06-22_15-19-24.mp4) How to edit and add your Adaption project to the mta.yaml ? Please help provide solution. Thank you,  2022-06-17 10:14:07 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
If I understand your requirment correctly, you want to create an adapation project on Cloud Foundry (CF);
https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP%20Business%20Application%20Studio/584e0bcbfd4a4aff91c815cefa0bce2d/019b0c38a6b043d1a66b11d992eed290.html
However, in your case you dont have a root mta.yaml created.
First, you need to ensure there is a root mta.yaml which is the deployment configuration that build build and deploy your apps;
Step1. Open the command palette `View` -> `Find Command` a. Enter `Wizard` and select `Open Template Wizard` b Select `Basic Multitarget Application` and press `Next` c. Enter a unique project name, unique within your organisation i.e. the name is used as MTA ID in the `mta.yaml` file

**Note**: SAP Application Studio will restart itself with the new project as root folder
Step2. Right click the newly generated `mta.yaml` and select `Create MTA Module from Template` a. Select ` Configuration` and press `Start` b. Select your HTML5 application runtime `Managed ` c. Enter a unique name for the business solution of the project | Enter a unique ID e.g. ` -service` from step 1.c d. Do you plan to add a UI? `Yes`
You will now have the ability edit and add your Adaption project to the mta.yaml.
Please refer back to me if this is your requirement?
Thanks.

Hello Customer, Thank you for reaching out.  Currently we support Basic Authentication for the OData URL that you provide directly.  We support SSO OAuth for SAP ABAP Systems by allowing the user to upload a service key file that contains the ABAP system information. We are currently investigating updating to support SAML authentication for SAP ABAP Systems in a similar fashion but there is no date for delivery just yet.  I hope that helps clarify the situation.

Hi ****,

I asked customer to try this command. I tested it on ****, but not sure if it is the right way to pass multiple environment variables on terminal. NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0; no_proxy=em-bm01.khi.co.jp; code If it doesn't work, step 3 of this document also provide instruction for setting environment variable in Windows. You can tell customer to set both NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED and no_proxy using this way.

Dear customer,

It looks like we have passed the the proxy issue. Fiori generator is now able to reach the server, and the error you see is because your server is using a self signed certificate.

As a quick work around, can you try to add this environment variable setting "NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0" when you start vscode? Like this:
NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0; no_proxy=em-bm01.khi.co.jp; code

Note NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0 is a temporary workaround, and can bring security vulnerability to your computer and your corp network.

The proper fix is to add this self signed CA to your local computer’s trust store. Please follow this documentation to add your CA to trust store. You can contact your IT to obtain the CA file: https://help.sap.com/viewer/17d50220bcd848aa854c9c182d65b699/Latest/ja-JP/4b318bede7eb4021a8be385c46c74045.html

[9/18 0:51] Lin, ****

Wilson, 我在想有可能vscode 的bypass list没有传到我们的tool里面。 VSCode的proxy setting是设置环境变量http_proxy. 这个环境变量正好我们用的http client (axios) 也会读取， 所以vscode 的proxy setting 也应用到了Fiori generator extension 里面。 但是vscode 的bypass list 可能没有传进来。 axios 现在支持的方式是设置一个 no_proxy 的环境变量。 no_proxy='em-bm01.khi.co.jp' 用户是Windows机器的话， 环境变量最好到Control Panel -> Advanced system settings -> Environment Variables 下面添加。 然后打开一个新的CMD terminal, 输入 echo %no_proxy% 验证设置是不是成功了。 然后重启vscode测试下。

​
[9/18 1:09] ****, ****

我试了一下。 我在vscode proxy setting 里面设置了一个错误的proxy. 然后用Fiori app generator 访问 https://sap-ux-mock-services-v2-lrop.cfapps.us10.hana.ondemand.com/sap/opu/odata/sap/SEPMRA_PROD_MAN 会出错。 说明vscode 的proxy设置传递到axios http client里面。完全关掉vscode, 然后用下面的命令重新启动：

no_proxy=sap-ux-mock-services-v2-lrop.cfapps.us10.hana.ondemand.com code

虽然还有错误的proxy 设置， 但是这个odata service 又可以访问了，说明这个命令应该有效果。可以让客户试一下:

It is possible the bypass list for vscode is only processed by vscode, but not recognized by Fiori app generator's axios http client. I checked axios documentation, it supports a no_proxy environment variable, the values provided to no_proxy env var will bypass proxy. I tested this environment variable by using the following setting. 1. Add an invalid proxy in vscode settings. 2. **** Fiori app generator to access our mock odata service. It fails since we provide an invalid proxy.
https://sap-ux-mock-services-v2-lrop.cfapps.us10.hana.ondemand.com/sap/opu/odata/sap/SEPMRA_PROD_MAN 3. Quit vscode completely. Restart it with the following command. It passes no_proxy environment variable to vscode.
no_proxy=sap-ux-mock-services-v2-lrop.cfapps.us10.hana.ondemand.com code
4. Repeat step 2. Now access the odata service succeeded even when I have the invalid proxy setting in vscode. Wilson will suggest customer to try the following command to bypass proxy for their corp server.

Dear customer, Thanks for testing this. I guess your issue is similar to this issue: https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/44941 By reading this thread, my understanding is you need proxy config in vscode to access public internet urls outside your corporate. E.g. **** UI (the tool you open by running '**** Template Wizard' command to **** Fiori app generator) checks if there is newer version of extensions to install. But you also need to configure a list of corporate domains that should bypass proxy in vscode. This configuration is now supported in vscode. But you can't configure it in vscode config setting. According to Setup Visual Studio Code's Network Connection,  you need to provide the bypass list by launching vscode from command line. E.g. code --proxy-bypass-list="localhost:8080;127.0.0.1:8080;*khi.co.jp*"
"code" is the command to **** vscode from command ****. I just provide an example list. You may want to obtain the list of bypass domains in your browser proxy configuration. Unfortunately, we don't need to explicitly provide the bypass domain list in SAP to work. **** I am not able to verify this approach personally. Please test and hopefully it is going to work for you.

Dear customer,

- VS Codeはプロキシ経由の通信が前提となっているツールであるのか (Is VS Code a tool that requires communication via a proxy?)

VS Code supports proxy configuration. It is required if you need to reach the host via a proxy. An example would be excel sheet 2 in Fiori tool tests. The sap ux mock server host is accessible from internet. If you are within a corporate network and you need internet access via your corporate proxy server, you need to configure the proxy server in vs code. Fiori app generator, as an extension running in vscode, inherits the proxy configuration in vscode and successfully reach the sap ux mock server via your corporate proxy.

However, communication to server https://em-bm01.khi.co.jp:44301 via your corporate proxy gave 503 Service Unavailable error. I would suggest you investigate the following:

- I found a screenshot of your proxy setting in your PC. *khi.co.jp* is in the list of hosts that should bypass proxy. Could you try to remove the proxy configuration in vscode and test again on https://em-bm01.khi.co.jp:44301?
- When you test, can you log the detailed error message on the ‘Output’ terminal on vscode like you did last time. External Info from Customer on 2021-09-08 05:32:55 [UTC]:

Dear customer, We went through the following together.
First, we corrected the misconfigured proxy port number in vscode proxy config. This error also shows evidence that the request went through your corporate proxy. I.e. when default port 80 was used, the error was reported from the proxy server.
After fixing the proxy config, we tested connection to a publicly available odata service (excel sheet 2 in Fiori tool tests). And we can able to connect to an available service after fixing the proxy config in vscode. It indicates fiori tool can successful connect to an available host through your corp proxy.
Finally, the error log you captured in your latest reply shows http resonse code 503 with error message “domain name does not exist” in the log. This error indicates the host is not available. Based on these tests, I strongly feel the issue is related to something specific in your corporate network environment if you have verified the host and the service are running.

Dear customer, Thank you very much to conduct the testing. The first command succeeded indicates the connection was successful without explicit proxy configuration. The second command you used failed, but it was my fault that I didn't make it clear you need to replace the following part in the command with your proxy config. http:// : I checked the proxy config you provided before in the error screenshot, so the command you use should be:
node axios-http-proxy.js https://sap-ux-mock-services-v2-alp.cfapps.us10.hana.ondemand.com/sap/opu/odata/sap/SEPMRA_ALP_SO_ANA_SRV http://vipview1.khi.co.jp:8080
I also notice a possible misconfiguration in proxy_error.xlsx in the attachment: https://itsm.services.sap/redirector.do?genericParameters={"number":"012R586k7jkZkf7NQCUWwG","source":"attachment"} Fixing this might help to solve the proxy config issue on this error screenshot. The problem is the PC proxy config has port number 8080, but the proxy config in vscode doesn't have port number specified. Thus vscode picks the default port number 80. The error message on Fiori app generator tool is also evidence of this misconfiguration, which complains connection failure to proxy domain port 80. You can correct the proxy config in vscode by setting the proxy to http://vipview1.khi.co.jp:8080 in the Http:Proxy section. Please let us know if this fix helps.

Hi ****,

The error reported by the customer in your most recent response ('****not read property 'edmx' of undefined') is different to previous errors. I'm not sure what is causing this as the my last request was for the user to provide more debug logs for the errors.

Can you get them to confirm the steps to cause this error? It would indicate that they are no longer getting errors with the odata service/system details that they are entering, but I cant be sure.

Is it possible to set up a call with customer? It would be much easier to provide support for the issues they are facing. Let me know if this is possible.

GH Issue https://github.wdf.sap.corp/ux-engineering/tools-suite/issues/14170 created Internal Info on 2021-06-17 07:54:25 [UTC]:
Summary:
- the customer uses  Visual Studio Code to develop Fiori UI elements
- it looks to me, originally the customer reported issues when tried to Connect to an OData Service from the template wizard (see Visual+studio+code_connect+error.xlsx)
- Ian proposed to check the settings, see proxy_error.xlsx for the results
- after seetings were done, a new error occured, **** stated it could be related to trying to use https when http is required
- since a certificate issue occured, **** asked the customer to install the cert to the 'Trusted Root Certificate Authorities' store
- later was reported, the certificate issue was solved but a timeout issue occured (but **** mentioned it's not evident the cert issue was solved)
- as I took over the case, an error message wsa reported which looked as an issue with the henerator itself, so I asked the customer to re-instal the generator
- after that, "An error occurred: self signed certificate’" occurs

From my point of view it's an issue is with the certificate. External Info from Customer on 2021-06-16 23:29:05 [UTC]:

Hi ****,

I've reviewed the latest attached document. From this it is not clear the customer has a timeout issue, the screenshot shows a cert error.

Regarding the reported issue of timeout, can you get them to confirm and check the following
- From previous documents they have uploaded, they are trying to use 'Connect to SAP System' and 'Connect to an OData Service' options in the application generator. Can you get them to confirm which one they are getting the timeout for? Please ensure they try using the 'Connect to OData Service' method if they have not tried this since the cert issues were resolved
- Please get them to enable more logging by following these steps:
For Windows
1. Ensure VSCode is added to 'path' environmental variable. This can be done directly in VSCode via the Command Palette in VSCode (search for 'path' in Command Palette)
2. **** all vscode windows
3. on terminal/command prompt run 'set AXIOS_LOG=true'
4. on terminal/command prompt run 'code'
5. Re-run steps in VSCode to get error, and copy logs from the 'output' channel of `Application Wizards.Generators` into this ticket
- Is this the only way to contact them? Is there any possibility to set up a meeting with them? Its difficult to diagnose the issue which is frustrating for us and I'm sure for them also. Let me know what we can do here

Kind regards,
****

Product Area selected: SAP S/4HANA > Cross Components Component selected (Manual Selection): CA-UX-IDE --- Description --- We have designed custom UI5 application, where it's accepting many special characters for Material Value. On the ODATA Backend side, we this field is of CHAR40 type, so that's not the problem. But if we are trying Material value having special character Forward Slash / , we are getting error message "Invalid URI Segment" and unable to proceed. Even, it is not hitting ODATA service. I am thinking this is UI5 related issue. Kindly guide us to fix this issue. Please check attached pictures. FYI- We are using BAS tool for our application designing.

Hi ,
You are right, encodeURI() does not encode "/", but encodeURIComponent() does. See also:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/encodeURI https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/encodeURIComponent?retiredLocale=de
If your material number contains characters that have a meaning in an URI you might need to encode it using encodeURIComponent().
Let me know if your issue is solved.

Kind regards,  SAP UX Engineering
2023-01-10 14:58:27 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi ,
As per my understanding, the encodeURI() method does not encode characters like:
, / ? : @ & = + $ * #
Hence, I am using the encodeURIComponent() method instead.
I am already using this, but i think I have got the issue. Currently I am encoded complete URI, instead of that, I need to only encode Material Number value. Let me try this approach and will give you update soon. 2023-01-10 07:22:51 -  (D045154) (External Info)
See my message below 2023-01-10 07:13:39 -  (D045154) (External Info)
Hello ,
It looks like escaping of values with JavaScript functions like encodeURI() and encodeURIComponent() is missing. To analyze whether the issue is with the UI5 framework or the application, could you please archive and attach the project to this ticket? If you are using the SAP Business Application Dev Space SAP Fiori or you use Microsoft Visual Studio Code with SAP Fiori tools extensions, you can easily archive the project while excluding the node_modules folder using command palette:
View -> Command Palette -> Fiori: Archive Project
to create a zip archive of the project.

Kind regards,  SAP UX Engineering

Hello customer,
It looks like your Fiori project may have been created or migrated with an older version of our Fiori tools.  The deploy command looks incorrect.  Can you please do the following:

- In your project folder, delete the package-lock.json file and then run `npm install`.  This will install the latest version of our tools.
- Please open `package.json` with your editor and replace the deploy target with:

"deploy": "npm run build && fiori deploy --config ui5-deploy.yaml && rimraf archive.zip",

Then please run `npm run deploy` again and hopefully the archive will not be blank.

Regards,

Customer's project needs to be tested/deployed in our internal system to see if we are able to replicate the issue 2022-05-13 20:38:45 -  (I829208) (External Info)
Hi ,
This is  from SAP Fiori tools team and your issue was sent to our component by our backend colleagues. Based on their analysis, it seems that SAP Fiori tools is sending an empty zip during deployment. We are not aware of such an issue so it will be great if you could provide us with your project and attach it over here.
You have 2 options:
1. Use command "Fiori: Open Environment Check" and select "Archive Project" and select your project. A zip file with node_modules folder is generated. Please attach the zip file here in the tictet.
2. You can do this manually, by first removing the "node_modules" folder from your project and zip it.

Your project will help us analyze why in your case empty zip file is generated by Fiori tools before deploying.

Best Regards,
 2022-05-13 07:51:59 -  (D041307) (Internal Info)

In this message I will only refer to the destination to fetch the current user to simplify the scenario. The application ran locally throws this error: "Cannot GET /user-api/currentUser". The same application runs perfectly on Cloud Foundry (and this means that there's no error in the application itself). We've discussed the issue with Mr.  and Mr.  from SAP and Mr.  did manage to reproduce the issue by creating a sample application that fetched the current user.

Dear Customer,

Unfortunately user API requests require SSO, which is not currently supported by "fiori-tools-proxy" middleware. We have a ticket for supporting this in our backlog, but currently we do not have a timeline when it will be available.

For the time being you could try using app router locally to serve the app instead of fiori-tools-proxy. Here is a tutorial that could help you set up the app router locally https://blogs.sap.com/2020/05/13/sap-cloud-platform-backend-service-tutorial-33-app-router-4-run-locally/.

Dear colleague,

The customer cannot preview fiori application in BAS, please check reproduce step in attachment Issue_CurrentUser_Recording.zip. This application can run normally in Cloud Foundry.

The customer use user-api service. The customer already provide the project, please check attachment sapcp.CF-US4SD09668-PW-grouptouser.tar.zip. After binding service in configuration tab in BAS, the issue still exists. Could you please help check this issue from your side?

Best regards,  SAP Product Support 2022-04-12 08:19:52 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Dear , I did that to no avail. I chose to use ui5.yaml which is defined as per attachment. It does not contain any reference to user-api but it works on D71 (our dev environment) as is. What are we supposed to do to use the user api in preview mode? Regards  2022-04-12 05:53:42 -  (I342495) (External Info)
Dear ,

You need to bind the dependency to a Cloud Foundry service when you preview the application: 1. Open the Run Configurations view. 2. Select the desired configuration. 3. Select the desired dependency. 4. Click  (bind). If not already logged in, you're prompted to log in to Cloud Foundry. A list of all available services that match your dependency type are displayed in the command palette. 5. Select the desired service.

It seems like you didn't do this, please share more details in the following help document: https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP%20Business%20Application%20Studio/9c36fdb911ae4cadab467a314d9e331f/149f285d410642c291855258aa13a46d.html
If you do, please share the run configuration to me.

Best regards,  SAP Product Support - APJ 2022-04-11 08:37:40 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Dear , I already sent you the whole project. The configuration is therefore the same and there's no need, in my view, to send it across again. Can you try and see why current user ain't fetch when it's run locally? Thanks  2022-04-11 06:34:25 -  (I342495) (External Info)
Dear ,

Thanks for separate the api issue in this incident, please share the run configuration in this case.
It seems like you didn't bind the service in the run configuration. Could you please help check this issue from your side?

Hello ,
I was able to make it work.The issue was that besides the missing configuration in the "ui5.yaml", the destination configuration also needed some additional configuration.
I created the destination "usageapi_". This one has the correct configuration. Please adapt your other destinations. After adapting the destinations the backend section of the "ui5.yaml" should look like this:

backend:
- path: /reporting
url: https://uas-reporting.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com
pathReplace: /
destination: usageapi

Hi ,
Are you aware of below scenario? The Fiori application is able to access the Resource Consumption APIs when the application is deployed, but not when using our ui5 tooling middleware for preview. Is this a restriction or can this be achieved by correct configuration of our middleware?

Dear colleagues,

The customer wants to consume the Resource Consumption APIs locally from BAS, and needs assistance with the project setup.
When they deploy their application in CF, the are able to see the data from the APIs successfully, meaning that from the Resource Consumption APIs perspective everything is fine, and they use it correctly.
They want the ability to get real data from the APIs also when working locally, without the need to deploy it on CF. The sandbox as data source is not an option for them, as they don't want to see test data.

Please assist the customer with the project setup and configurations, if their request is valid and possible.

Best regards,

Hello Ido, Yes in case of a meeting I will ensure that relevant colleagues will be on the call. Regarding the "Standalone approuter" and "Managed approuter" - yes, we would like to get clarity on what are the current limitiations & what approach to be used and also the required project configurations. 1. "We are not able to consume the Resource Consumption API by configuring a Destination in the BTP cockpit"
We tried to consume the Resource consumption API using the Standalone router approach but when we do this, we cannot run the application locally from BAS. I have attached the document("Steps to recreate the issue") wherein I have mentioned the steps we have done and have also attached screenshots("accessIssue").
2. We are looking to consume the BTP API and a couple of more APIs for developing applications. We would like to run it locally in BAS(by consuming real data) during our development. So the query regarding approuter, point 1 & point 2(mentioned above) ultimately is leading to the our main blocker of frontend project setup to run the application locally from BAS. Please check and let us know how we can proceed. Thanks,   2023-01-08 07:25:53 -  (I308060) (External Info)
Hello ,

Before setting I meeting I just want to clarify with you few things, so in case of a meeting, the relevant colleagues will be in the call.
Regrading your question about "Standalone approuter" and "Managed approuter" - As far as I know there is a problem with the Managed approuter, but if this is a blocker for you, I can ask again the relevant experts to assist here.
Regarding you second question:
1. Can you please elaborate more about this scenario - " We are not able to consume the Resource Consumption API by configuring a Destination in the BTP cockpit". Can you add the steps you did and maybe screenshots to describe the flow?
2. As I proposed in my previous comment, if you are looking to run the application locally in BAS and consume real data - I will have to ask the colleagues from BAS team to support.

So please let me know which one of the options is the one you want to tackle first, and I will ask the relevant colleagues to support.

Best regards,
Ido

Hi Ido, When selecting "Connect to SAP API Business Hub" from the data source drop down, you are able to consume test data from a Sandbox system if it is configured for the selected API. - This is not exactly our requirement. Issue: We are trying to consume the Resource Consumption API in SAP FIORI application via SAP BAS. 1. We are able to consume the API from the FIORI application only via "Standalone approuter" and not via "Managed approuter" - Is this a limitation ? 2. We are not able to consume the Resource Consumption API by configuring a Destination in the BTP cockpit and we are also unable to run the application locally in SAP BAS. These are hampering the development of a critical customer project. We can have a short call in which I can explain the issue we are facing. Thanks,   2023-01-04 07:33:52 -  (I308060) (External Info)
Dear Customer,
When selecting "Connect to SAP API Business Hub" from the data source drop down, you are able to consume test data from a Sandbox system if it is configured for the selected API.
As mentioned before by , this option is not yet configured for the Resource Consumption APIs.
However, before raising a feature request to the team to support this, I wanted to verify with you that it will fulfills your requirements.
Having this configuration will return only test data in order to see that the API is working properly, but it will not return real data as the one you see once you deploy your app to CF env, and use your credentials when sending the requests.
If this is sufficient, we can proceed with the backlog, and update you when it will be ready. But if you wish to see real data locally, like you see after the deployment, then we will need to involve BAS experts in order to understand if there are any settings that need to be set in order to get your data locally.

Please let me know which solution you are referring to, and then we will proceed accordingly.

Hi , The first way of consuming the API does not return data while running the application from BAS locally which is hampering our development(as every code change has to be deployed to cockpit and checked). Can you please check & advise if there are any project settings which we have to maintain to get the data when the applications(which consume the APIs) are run locally from BAS.

Dear customer,
As far as I understand, the first way of consuming the API returned data successfully after the deployment. Currently, the second way to access the resource consumption API is not supporting the SANDBOX environment.

Hi Colleagues,
The API https://api.sap.com/api/APIUasReportingService/tryout has nothing to do with us, we are not sure how we can help here. The API HUB team said that in this API's "try out" section there is no Sandbox environment option like in other APIs, which is causing the issues for the customer.
Please check further.
Thank you,

Hi ,
As discussed on call with you, your API is missing SANDBOX environment due to which this issue is coming.
https://api.sap.com/api/API_OPLACCTGDOCITEMCUBE_SRV/tryout API has sandbox configuration for your reference.
You can reach out to our content admin team for more details regarding sandbox environment().

This ticket is being moved around different teams and no one seems to know what is causing this issue.
In your last reply here you said:
"
This issue can be resolved once you enable API Business Hub Sandbox for your API. Please check.

Can you elaborate on this? who needs to enable "API Business Hub Sandbox" ? and what do you mean by "enable" ?

Hi Colleagues,
Customer is getting attached error "Error_APIHubService.png" while trying to select a resource consumption API.
The error message is:
"An error occurred: The selected service [object Object] doesn't expose a ServiceUrl property, please try again with a different service"
The incident was openen in one of the component of BAS but that was incorrect. It was then checked by different team and then routed to LOD-CHB-API. However, as per them  the LOD-CHB-API team is not responsible for the APIs themselves that can be downloaded from API Business Hub.
On checking this API APIUasReportingService was mentioned most of the time in cases from component: BC-NEO-MET-REP.

I'm not really sure if this should be chekced by us. However, could you please have a look if we can help the customer or if not, please help in identifying the right team for this one.

Hi colleagues,

As discussed, Fiori tools have investigated the issue and it looks like the APIhub API is not returning a service URL for use in all cases.  From our investigation:

Out of the 740 services the API returns, 473 have null ServiceUrl properties.
g = require('@sap/apihub-service-provider').getListODataServices
// All services
g().then(a => console.dir(a.length))

// Services with ServiceUrl falsy
g().then(a => a.filter(s => !s.ServiceUrl)).then(a => console.dir(a.length)) 2022-09-21 00:18:38 -  (I031735) (External Info)

Dear customer,
It is not recommended to have CAP and non-CAP Fiori applications within the same CAP project. For adding Fiori applications inside a CAP project, please ensure that you are using a CAP data source, so that the application can be correctly generated.
The blog post at https://blogs.sap.com/2022/02/10/build-and-deploy-a-cap-project-node.js-api-with-a-sap-fiori-elements-ui-and-a-managed-approuter-configuration/?source=email-global-notification-bp-new-in-tag-followed details how Fiori applications get generated for a CAP project.
In this case, please generate your Fiori application with a CAP data source, and choose `None` as the Cloud Foundry destination name. Then please see step 6 onwards, where it details how you can update your local CAP application to reference a destination. 2022-02-14 06:11:22 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Dear . Thanks for the update. We will wait for the new blog post. But mean time could you please let me know how to use the external services in CAP project using OData services .? I really appreciate your help here. Thank you. 2022-02-10 12:59:40 -  (I313149) (Internal Info)

Dear customer,

Generating a non-CAP Fiori application inside a CAP project is not supported by the Fiori tools currently, this is the flow you are trying to implement.

We are currently in the process of publishing a blog post which will show how to use a CAP project with a Fiori project that has a non-CAP data source.  Once this blog is posted we will update this issue.  The blog will hopefully go live during the next day.

Thanks for taking the call today;
The root cause of the 404 was the enablement of the ABAP Repo service on the target environment.
Once enabled, customer was able to deploy but got a virus provider exception. Additional links were provided.
Any additional issues with ABAP configuration/deployment will be direct to the ABAP component since there are no issues with Fiori Tools.
Additional information was provided around using git and source control to managed the deployment of their Fiori app to different target systems.

Hi,
Before we setup a call I need to understand your issue in more detail as we dont have expereicne with SAP BW/4HANA 2.0 so I will need to involve another team to support this issue.
Have you been provided with any documentation to configure a Frontend server to support own developed Fiori Applications? Please refer to https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2733740
Just to be clear, the tutorial https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/fiori-tools-generate-project.html is referencing an ES5 service URL and does not reference any deployment steps to ABAP.
Can you confirm your data source? Was it a OData service URL? How was the Fiori App generated?
Please attach your app for further review;
zip -r feproject.zip ./ / -x */\.* *.git* \.* *.zip *.env* *.mta *.rb *.bak *.swp *.DS_Store *.back *.merge *.txt *.sh **/resources/\* **/mta-op-*/\* **/gen/\* **/node_modules/\* **/mta_archives/\* **/dist/\* **/.ABAPDeployResources/\* **/.vscode/\*
Replace with the path to root for your project ie /home/projects/myproject
Based on your response I will hopefully be able to determine which team can help with your specific issue.

Hi , kindly refer  below for your questions ,  for quickly  the problem , as we can't deploy code to the system , would you please have an remote assist ? thank you very much . and my mobile phone numbers is  *PHONE* , thanks Can you eleborate what this BW product is? Is this an SAP provided product? BW Product ： SAP BW/4HANA 2.0 steps for  deploying a Fiori app to a ABAP target system： we refer the document of this link: https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/fiori-tools-generate-project.html is this an abap target system? yes it's an ABAP target system 2022-06-24 09:12:47 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
I dont understand what the BW dev IP address is? In order to deploy your Fiori application to an abap host which is an SAP backend host.
Can you eleborate what this BW product is? Is this an SAP provided product?
Have you received any steps for deploying a Fiori app to a ABAP target system?
When generating the ABAP deployment config, it prompted you for the target system URL, this is where you entered the IP address but is this an abap target system?

Dear Sap Team, http://192.168.10.134 is our BW dev ip address, we can connect the server  without  network , does deploy to an abap system only need a public accessible address? thanks. 2022-06-23 12:53:41 -  (I313149) (External Info)

Hi,
Can you please clarify the usage of IP address http://192.168.10.134 as 192.168 IP range is reserved for networks such as your home LAN.
The referenced IP address is not a public accessible address so I dont understand how you can deploy to an ABAP system?

Dear Sap Team, Please find  FIORI6.png,    ping  server IP address is ok, and the firewalls always closed.  thanks. 2022-06-22 09:12:24 -  (I515700) (External Info)
Dear customer,
Please assist with the following queries to better analyse the problem.
1. Please verify the IP address is reachable by pinging it via a terminal or browser and attach the results.
2. Can you confirm if there are any proxy/firewalls that might be blocking their request?
3. Was the app created in VSCode and did you follow a specific tutorial to create this app? Additionally, where did you get the destination properties from?

Dear Customer,
It appears from the screenshot fiorip1.png that the IP address is not reachable. Please verify the backend is reachable from VSCode.
Additionally, can you please ensure that you have service /UI5/ABAP_REPOSITORY_SRV activated in your backend system? It looks like it cannot be found.

Hi ,
Can you please tell whats the open point here? As it was mentioned earlier, the warnings you see has no impact in deployment. If you want to get rid of those warnings, you need to provide correct authorizations to your user as mentioned in in section 2.1/2.1.1 in https://help.sap.com/doc/2e65ad9a26c84878b1413009f8ac07c3/201909.001/en-US/config_guide_system_backend_abap_development_tools.pdf

Can you please let us know whats opening in this ticket and whether you were able to get past the warnings?

Dear customer,
Could you lower the priority of this incident? As I mentioned in my last reply, this incident is not BLOCKING. You can continue the deploy config.

The authorizations have been discussed here in section 2.1/2.1.1 in https://help.sap.com/doc/2e65ad9a26c84878b1413009f8ac07c3/201909.001/en-US/config_guide_system_backend_abap_development_tools.pdf Could you check if it helps?
Best regards
 2022-07-12 17:01:43 -  (I829208) (Internal Info)
Hi ,
This incident at this point should not be a very high.
Please reiterate to the customer that they are NOT BLOCKED by any means. As you have already mentioned that they can still go ahead and generate deploy config and deploy too. May be they did not understand? Trying again in step wise manner might help.

Secondly, the respective authorizations have been discussed here in section 2.1/2.1.1
https://help.sap.com/doc/2e65ad9a26c84878b1413009f8ac07c3/201909.001/en-US/config_guide_system_backend_abap_development_tools.pdf
You can also ask them to take a look above.

But please decrease the prio to at least high

Hi Team , I have test the below service https://*SAP-ID*-ds4.priv.nprd.fin.purolator.com:443/sap/bc/adt/ato/settings. Output is attached  in the document 2022-07-08 18:17:51 -  (I830561) (External Info)
Dear customer, During deploy config, we send a request to this http service "/sap/bc/adt/ato/settings" to fetch some metadata for input validation. Your error indicates there is a 403 error when trying to fetch the metadata.
First, this error is not critical for your deploy config, you can still continue the generation steps and successfully generate the deploy config.
The 403 error indicates your on-premise user credential logged in successfully but is not authorized to access this rest service. If you would like to remove this error message, please verify your user has enough authorization to access adt services. You can directly test this service by sending a GET http request on URL "https:// : /sap/bc/adt/ato/settings". Or just simply put this url on the browser and verify the response. If it is successful, you should receive a XML as response.
Best regards,

Hi , We have validated the https://blogs.sap.com/2020/04/24/sap-fiori-for-sap-s-4hana-adaptation-transport-organizer/ and we in our case we have default ATO setup already in place. Based on your comment from 5th July "It appears that some resource in abap system is not configured as needed."
Could you please let us know how to trace missing resource or in case you wish to access the system and analyze further we have the connection open already.

Kindly help us at the earliest.
Regards
 2022-07-07 15:51:15 -  (D022159) (External Info)
Hello , OK, obviously not an authorization problem then. Besides, my colleague  gave some hints  concerning the ATO settings on July 5th. Did you analyze this, following the description at https://blogs.sap.com/2020/04/24/sap-fiori-for-sap-s-4hana-adaptation-transport-organizer/? Best regards,  2022-07-07 15:26:02 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi , We did cross check KBA : 2446600 even this did not help.
Service /sap/bc/adt is already active in backend S/4 and exposed from Cloud Connector as well.

Attached is the user authorization trace taken while replicating the issue and the list of exposed services from cloud connector for your analysis

Hello , Please consider note https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/0002446600 - this could help solving your backend issues. Best regards,  2022-07-05 09:38:02 -  (D022159) (External Info)
Dear , Let me first share the results from the CA-BAS-AUT colleagues:
We can see in the attached logs that the connectivity is OK and the response (403) is returned from the backend server.
You can see in the sccs_logs (ljs_trace) that the tunnel is successfully open (see log below). As well as, we can also see that when running curl from the terminal, user gets 200 (look for "curl -v http://ds4_020.dest/sap/opu/odata/iwfnd/CATALOGSERVICE/$metadata" in BAS Issue.docx attached doc).
It appears that some resource in abap system is not configured as needed. From your BAS Issue.docx I can see that the user zincomingpayments is used. From the BAS error.docx it is evident that the deployment tried to get the transport configuration. So, would you please - check the authorization of user zincomingpayments for the given backend - do an authorization trace in this backend to see what exactly fails. Best regards,  2022-07-05 09:11:22 -  (I313149) (Internal Info)
FYI
In some instances, the ABAP system has a lower version that doesn't support ATO settings service /sap/bc/adt/ato/settings. Destination to the ABAP system requires authentication.
Please refer to https://blogs.sap.com/2020/04/24/sap-fiori-for-sap-s-4hana-adaptation-transport-organizer/
To enable authentication, follow these steps
Step1.Update ui5-deploy.yaml
credentials:
username: env:UI5_USERNAME
password: env:UI5_PASSWORD
Step2. Create a .env inside the same folder where ui5-deploy.yaml is located
UI5_USERNAME=MyUsername
UI5_PASSWORD=****
https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sap/ux-ui5-tooling and scrolling down to "Setting environment variables in a .env file"

Dear colleagues,
We can see in the attached logs that the connectivity is OK and the response (4003) is returned from the backend server.
You can see in the sccs_logs (ljs_trace) that the tunnel is successfully open (see log below). As well as, we can also see that when running curl from the terminal, user gets 200 (look for "curl -v http://ds4_020.dest/sap/opu/odata/iwfnd/CATALOGSERVICE/$metadata" in BAS Issue.docx attached doc).
It appears that some resource in abap system is not configured as needed, please help the customer to find what is missed.

Hello , I read through all the information but could not see any indication of a tools problem. Refer to our support guidelines https://wiki.wdf.sap.corp/wiki/display/fioritech/Common+Generation+and+Deployment+customer+issues+and+suggested+responses#:~:text=1.%C2%A0App%20Studio%3A%20Customer%20cannot%20connect%20to%20destination%2C%20an%20error%20is%20displayed%20in%20the%20wizard%20when%20trying%20to%20use%20it%20as%20a%20data%20source%3A "If it is confirmed that the destination is not correctly returning the list of services, then we should ask the customer for the following information (taken from BAS Connectivity Troubleshooting) and reassign the ticket to CA-BAS-AUT" - this is exactly the case for the customer, as the curl did end up in a 403 response code. So, would you please support the customer in finding the configuration problem they obviously have? I guess you will have some troubleshooting information that you can share, don't you?
Thanks  2022-07-05 07:33:54 -  (D022159) (External Info)
Dear , I am sorry but after checking all the information that you provided is is evident that it is not a tools' problem (CA-UX-IDE) but obviously an authorization issue, probably caused by a wrong configuration. I hope that the colleagues from CA-BAS-AUT can check this with you. 2022-07-04 15:29:14 -  (I531230) (Internal Info)
Dear Colleagues,
Customer is facing an issue with the following error:
"cannot get transport configuration from the backend
Error: Request failed with status code 403"
this is occurring when trying to access their on-premise s/4 system. Step by step screenshots can be seen in BAS error.docx
I have checked the customers cloud connector logs and do not see any issue and the time they reproduced the issue. Please see doc BAS Issue.docx for details on this.
The only error seen was:
"Access denied to resource / on system dwpflpsrv:123. In case this was a valid request, ensure to expose the resource correctly in your cloud connector"
This occurred after running curl -v http://.dest
The customer has now added the resource / to their cloud connector but are still facing the issue.
From research I can see some past cases in your component with this issue:

Hello , I understand your concerns, but please consider also the following. SAP Business Application Studio uses Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/) as underlying framework. It allows Business Application Studio to deliver nice features like the Command Line, GIT Integration and so on. Previously Business Application Studio was running on Node.js version 14. Node.js announced that version 14 goes out of maintenance at 30.04.2023. Therefore Business Application Studio was updated to Node.js version 16 in order to meet our obligation in delivering secure and stable software to our customers. Sometimes when Node.js  releases a new version, some packages may not work anymore, because e.g. something was changed in the core of the framework. But this is the exception, not the rule! Unfortunately the exception occurred here. A third-party package that we are using in “@sap/ux-ui5-tooling” stopped working with Node.js version 16. So we needed to update the dependencies in “sap/ux-ui5-tooling” and release a new version in order to fix the issue.
I hope this helps you to understand why the change was necessary.

Hello , but it does have a impact on live applications. For example this package includes a deployment tool. So we would need to deploy and test all our applications, to make sure deployment also works with this newest version. Its always good to keep software up to date. But forcing customers by making a stable version unusable, should not be the right way. This change was also unannounced, and we would need to change now about 50 applications. Why isn't it possible to make "Business Application Studio" backwards-compatible to older versions of @sap/ux-ui5-tooling? Thanks, and Best regards
 2022-07-20 15:02:41 -  (D062812) (External Info)
Dear customer, the “@sap/ux-ui5-tooling” package is part of the SAP Fiori tools. As such it is meant to be updated on a regular basis so that customers can receive the latest features and stability fixes. Updating the package won’t have any impact on the live applications.
Best regards,

Dear Colleagues,
Customer has the issue of:
https://support.wdf.sap.corp/sap/support/message/2280138605
They are not happy with having to update the @sap/ux-ui5-tooling version for all their projects manually.
Can you please advise the reason for this sudden requirement with no backwards compatability?
Best regards,

Hello, we are running alot of live applications that use this module on the specified version. Updating this module will result in a business risk. Because it handles alot of other processes too (for example deploying). For us, business application studio should be backwards compatible to "older" modules. The version we use isn't even that old. Its important that we can trust BAS, when we on our side use stable versions. Thanks, and Best regards
 2022-07-20 12:37:52 -  (I320514) (External Info)
Dear ,
Thank you for contacting SAP Support. The problem here as you discovered is the version of "@sap/ux-ui5-tooling" package is too old, this needs to be updated.
To do this you can execute the command:

then click on the action to update @sap/ux-ui5-tooling
Please let me know if this does not solve your issue. If this does resolve your issue please feel free to confirm this case as per KBA 1239839

Product Area selected:  Service and Support Infrastructure Component selected (Manual Selection): CA-BAS-RUN-HTML5 --- Description --- I am trying to implement a UI application using Fiori Elements using the OData service built using CAP as a data source. I tried to build an app according to the procedure of the attached Excel file, but until the day before yesterday, services such as App Router and Connectivity were created automatically, but when I performed the same procedure today, it was not created.

HI ,
I see. I experimented with the BTP ABAP environment before, and then ES5 and DS4. I think this may be the reason why the authentication fails. I'll use incognito mode to run the fiori application later.
Thanks again for your reply 2022-10-14 07:11:51 -  (I325307) (External Info)
Hi ,
I'm glad to hear you solved the issue. I run into the same issue and found that clearing the cache solves it too.
When you don't clear the browser cache, I think any previously entered passwords are saved and it wont accept any new ones. This happens more so when you are working with multiple systems and services. Once the browser cache is cleared, it removes those previously saved passwords and allows you to enter a correct one.
Another way to find this out is by running the browser in incognito (Chrome) or private mode (Edge). This also works because there are no previously saved passwords in that mode. It is running that browser window with a clear cache.
I hope this answers your question,
Kind regards,

The Fiori tools team 2022-10-14 06:17:51 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
HI SAP,
Thank you for your patience. I just solved this problem, literally by clearing the browser cache. When I previewed the application again, the validation box still appeared, but I entered the same username and password as before and passed.
Why does this work? 2022-10-14 03:27:07 -  (I829208) (External Info)
Hello ,
As communicated before, please clear your browser cache and try previewing your application again.

1.https://vhbfids4ci.sap.tp-link.com:44300/sap/opu/odata/sap/ZRICO_STRU_USR_SRV/?$format=xml maybe it can be access only in my company, because I can not access through my PC. 2.yes. the same credential I have enter to URL, but it did not work. 3.I dont know what is incognito mode mean, but I can see the mock data by "npm run start-mock" without credential. I will clear my cache tomorrow when I go to work. 4. Tomorrow I will do as you say. Thank you. 2022-10-13 10:26:12 -  (I325307) (External Info)
Hi ,
Sorry you are facing this issue. I hope we can help resolve this for you soon. Could you please provide more information on the following:
1. The OData url that you used during project generation.
2. Did you try your credentials for the system (DS4) from which the url refers? - I think you have already done this based on your last response...
3. Could you try running the app in incognito mode and see if your username / password is accepted then? It may be a case that you may need to clear your cache.
4. Finally, if that doesn't work, would it be possible for you to provided the app project to us by running the command `Fiori: Open Application Info` and select the `create archive tile` for the project you generated and attach the zip to this ticket. So we can take a closer look?
Kind regards,

1.we dont have an on-premise system, just use DS4 as out productive environment. 2.DS4 system is managed by SAP, and we develop business service on it. Maybe it's deployed on the SAP private cloud? Addition:
I used postman to test the Odata service released by DS4, and its verification information is the username and password for logging in the system. Also, I directly Call the browser to access the Odata service in the "/IWFND/MAINT_SERVICE" transaction, or copy the URL to the browser to access the service, also using the same authentication information, these are valid When I create a list report on VScode to consume the Odata service, I also need to fill in the same URL and verification information, which is no problem. The problem is that after I started the app, the browser that automatically opened asked me to fill in my identity, which made it impossible to use the previous information, and the browser kept popping up asking for my verification information 2022-10-12 14:18:49 -  (I829208) (External Info)
HI ,
Your ticket has reached SAP Fiori tools component and we will help you with your issue.
Can I get more clarity over your issue?
1. Are you trying with an on-premise system maintained by within your company?
2. You mentioned you also tried DS4. Can you tell who owns this system. (If its something like ES5 demo system, then sorry I did not know, but please confirm)
In general, in any onpremise system, to access its Odata services, you need to be authorized with the user you are trying to use.

Hello colleagues,
Sending to your component CA-UX-IDE  because the blog being followed by customer involves both OData and the "freestyle Fiori project" mentioned in the KB0170641:
Create destination in SAP BTP cockpit for backend data source service Start Business Application Studio Choose "Fiori" dev space Start from template Select "SAP Fiori" application and press Start Select any of freestyle or Fiori Elements template As Data source select "Connect to an SAP System" Select your system
If you cannot fully assist the customer please make a best effort to find a more appropriate team. The customer is not using my product at all, so I request you do not reassign to LOD-HCI-DS.

Hi, We are trying to implement as per below blog. https://blogs.sap.com/2020/09/28/sap-business-application-studio-with-sap-ui5-and-odata-service-binding/ 2021-08-25 15:02:42 -  (I845143) (External Info)
Hello , my name is  and I work at SAP Support in the USA.
You have reached the support team for "SAP Cloud Integration for data services". That product, called CPI-DS, does not interact with Fiori or UI5 at all, and also does not really interact with exposing OData to any customer applications. Since my work is focused on the one product above, I am not able to determine the best team to answer your questions currently.
Can you provide some more details about what you are trying to do? Perhaps some documentation from the SAP Product you are using, or a blog you tried to follow to set up this integration? I need some help to reroute this ticket to a more appropriate team that can properly support you.
Thanks and best regards,  SAP Support

--- Support Assistant --- Product / Product Area Selected SAP NetWeaver  > UI Technologies Path Taken None of these Product Area selected: SAP NetWeaver  > UI Technologies Component selected (Manual Selection): CA-BAS-EDT-HTML5 --- Description --- Dear support, We are trying to use vscode to develop UI5 application. We are using the fiori-tools-proxy as middleware. For the UI5 resources we are using http://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com. In our organization there is internal proxy for outbound access. Therefore to access it, we needed to configure the parameters: cafile, proxy, https-proxy, noproxy. To test the development we have one button that need to be filled with details from the gateway. However it is empty. From transaction /IWFND/TRACES we can see that the metadata was request successfully. Yet in the chrome developer tools the response is empty. We are not sure if it is the issue, but we think the issue is connected to the metadata that it is not loaded properly Best Regards,

Here is the detail information. Please check and provide the root cause and solution.

We created the CAP project including SAPUI5 Freestyle App. Also created the database artifacts and approuter configuration.

Then, we did the mta build process and it generated 'mtar' file. It can be successfully deployed to hana and CF using the generated 'mtar' file.

But when we check the result, the related sapui5 app cannot be shown under 'Web Applications' although already existed. It works fine when we test 'cds watch' in local environment. What we expected is the same result running in local. Please check the attachment for more detail.

For your reference, we also send the test project 'YZ_TEST02.tar' (download from BAS). Kindly check the root cause and let us know.

※If you need more information, please feel free to contact us.

Hi,
I'm including some additional links for you
https://answers.sap.com/questions/13500597/create-destination-for-deployed-application-from-m.html
https://blogs.sap.com/2020/07/22/how-to-integrate-ui5-with-sap-cap-application-as-the-destination-at-sap-cf-subaccount-level/
https://github.com/SAP-samples/cf-mta-examples/issues/39
If you read the cf-mta-examples link, it will show how you can create an instance and subaccount destination via your mta config. You could cleanup your mta so that both the instance and subaccount configurations expose the destination for the CAP service.
You can also create a subaccount destination manually, pointing to the URL exposed by the nodejs CAP app.
Please be aware, using a root mta.yaml, you can create mutiple UI apps within the same project. Take for example this repo https://github.com/SAP-samples/fiori-tools-samples/tree/main/cap/cap-fiori-mta,  you can right click the mta.yaml and select Create MTA Module from Template, allowing you to append multiple UI apps, resuing the same CAP service. This is a good blog on understanding managed approuter and the benefits of using a single mta.yaml to managed and deploy multiple apps
https://blogs.sap.com/2021/05/17/sap-tech-bytes-faq-managed-approuter-vs.-standalone-approuter/
Please let me know if you have any more questions.

2022-07-06 00:56:30 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Dear , Thanks for your support. If I understand you correctly, you want to expose the CAP project as a subaccount destination in your subaccount? Can you please confirm if this is correct? Yes, we would like to use subaccount destination instead of instance based destination. And, we also would like to create the cap project and fiori app separately (not the same project). The expectation steps is : 1. create the cap project including service catalog 2. deploy the cap project to CF 3. create the sap fiori app (not using local cap project and create as another project) 4. use the created database service deployed in step2. (using subaccount destination) 5. deploy the sap firoi app to CF. So, to achieve the above two goals, we would like to request some references such tutorials and blogs. For the first one, we will check the blogs you provided. Could you also provide the references for the second one? Best Regards, 2022-07-05 13:48:51 -  (I313149) (External Info)

Dear , Thanks for your support and sorry for my reply is late. We have checked the blogs you provided. We can create and deployed successfully the cap project with sap fiori app to CF.

(not choose 'using local cap project') ・based on you blogs information, we need to create the subaccount destinations to retrieve data from cap service (instead of instance based destination) For the above process, could you provide the reference tutorials or blogs? ※what we want is for SAP Hana Cloud Database, not S4 hana.

Hi,
To understand how routing works on Cloud Foundry using destinations, please refer to this link

Dear , Thank you for your reply. We will check the blogs you provided. However, you can only access the Fiori applications using destinations which is the routing between these applications on CF. Related with the destination, could you also provide the reference link? Best Regards, 2022-06-02 09:25:43 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
Please refer to this blog on understanding CAP Cloud Foundry (CF) deplpoyment
https://blogs.sap.com/2022/02/10/build-and-deploy-a-cap-project-node.js-api-with-a-sap-fiori-elements-ui-and-a-managed-approuter-configuration/
Your comment is correct, the apps will not be listed on the CAP project app URL on CF since they are deployed into separate processes and locations. When you run locally, the CDS start/watch command is reading the app directories. However, you can only access the Fiori applications using destinations which is the routing between these applications on CF. Local preview mode works differently as everything is assuming everything is exposed at localhost whch again is not the case when deployed to CF.
I hope this provides clarity to your questions/comments.

Hi Colleagues,

Customer created a CAP Node.js application with SAP Fiori Freestyle. Using cds watch, the BAS cds server shows links in the "Web Applications" section:

Web Applications: /customers/dist/index.html /customers/webapp/index.html

Service Endpoints: /catalog-service-i / $metadata → $metadata (V2) CUSTOMERS → CUSTOMERS (V2) → Fiori preview

When the application is deployed on CF, the Web Applications entries are missing:

Web Applications: — none —

Service Endpoints: /catalog-service-i / $metadata → $metadata (V2) CUSTOMERS → CUSTOMERS (V2)

In documentation I could find only this section to enable the preview in the deployed application as well

https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/advanced/fiori
"
To also enable this preview for the production profile, add the following configuration to your project’s package.json: cds.features.fiori_preview:true If you add this to your cdsrc.json omit the cds section

"

but could I not figure out how to make the "web applications" links available in the deployed on.

Best regards,

Hello ,
After further investigation, the vulnerability is related to the version of "ui5/cli" that is being included when generating your Fiori project.  This has been resolved and should mean that any future projects won't have this issue.

In order to update an existing project so that the vulnerability is no longer present, can you please do the following:

1. Open the package.json file from the root of your Fiori project.
2. Please update the versions of the following libraries in this file:
"@ui5/cli": "^2.10.4",
"@ui5/fs": "^2.0.6",
"@ui5/logger": "^2.0.1", 3. Execute `npm install` again on the project, and it should update these libraries and remove the vulnerability. Thanks,  2021-05-24 17:54:04 -  (I829208) (Internal Info)

Hello customer,
Thank you for reaching out. I am after generating an application using the steps that you have detailed in the associated word document, and none of the vulnerabilities you have mentioned are in the package.json in my case.
The package.json at the root, along side the MTA.yaml file, has the following data:

"devDependencies": {
"mbt": "^1.0.15",
"rimraf": "3.0.0"
}

And the package.json in the generated Freestyle application has the following:

"devDependencies": {
"@ui5/cli": "^2.10.1",
"@ui5/fs": "^2.0.6",
"@ui5/logger": "^2.0.1",
"@sap/ux-ui5-tooling": "1",
"rimraf": "3.0.2",
"@sap/ui5-builder-webide-extension": "1.0.x",
"ui5-task-zipper": "^0.3.1",
"mbt": "^1.0.15"
},

Can you please confirm that these vulnerabilities were added by the generator?  And if so, how we can re-create?

I will reduce the priority to medium in line with https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/67739
If you are still encountering problems after following the troubleshooting guides  above then revert back to use.
As this a holiday period we have limited support staff available especially for the next week. We would appreciate you are in a position to wait until after the holiday period.

Kind regards,

Dear colleagues,
The customer is using fiori tool to deploy to ABAP, but when the authentication setting for destination is basic the authentication will always fail. Only when set it to NoAuthentication, it would work.
Could you please help to check here?
Best regards, Roy 2022-03-29 03:10:21 -  (I058980) (External Info)
Dear customer,
I am involving our developers from fiori tools for further analysis.
Best regards, Roy 2022-03-29 02:07:03 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
dear team, I also changed the user password to not contain the any speicial character, it still not worked. I changed the Authentication setting of deploy destination from [BasicAuthentication] to [NoAuthentication], when I deploy input the user and password it worked. but using [BasicAuthentication] no matter what username and password I used, it doesn't work now. is there any buffer or cache related Authentication of destination? best regards. 2022-03-28 09:28:03 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
dear team, yes there are some speicial caracters in the password like '$' and '@'. is there any restriction for the speicial caracter? best regards, 2022-03-28 07:07:13 -  (I058980) (External Info)
Dear customer,
The user you need to use should have the permission to access the ABAP UI5 repository. Please also let me know whether there's any speicial character in the password of that user or not.

We are using Visual Studio for Fiori/UI5 Development.

When using template wizard and continue the steps, we get an error while selecting the service.

'Selected service is returning an error'.

Upon tracing using /iwfnd/traces, we see that response for that odata service call returns 403.

This same call is working from browser and returns the data.

on a side note - we also see Odata Version V2 - Recommended service unavailable (its looking for RecommendedServiceCollection entity set that does not exist).

Have you already created an incident for this? Vinodh Kumar [2021-06-10 12:13:49 UTC]: Custom service that is on distributed hub. OData GET call works fine on browser. howerver when used to create fiori app using tempalte wizard on VS code, we get this error.  i have not created an incident yet Grahame@SAP [2021-06-10 12:16:58 UTC]: ok thank you, and have you used this process before? what I mean is is there a service on the hub which has been created in this method before and is working? I will need to look into "template wizard on VS code" I am gateway engineer we work with odata requests which are failing, which I can see with the 403 error you traced but like the issue is happening on the creation side in this template wizard Vinodh Kumar [2021-06-10 12:18:43 UTC]: First time.  However the service on gateway system (fiori) is working fine. only the service on distributed system is throwing an error. Vinodh Kumar [2021-06-10 12:19:10 UTC]: I did not understand your message - 'I will need to look into "template wizard on VS code" and after. Grahame@SAP [2021-06-10 12:20:28 UTC]: Your description wrote : When using template wizard and continue the steps, we get an error while selecting the service.    'Selected service is returning an error'. I have no knowledge of what "template wizard" is it is not from my area Vinodh Kumar [2021-06-10 12:21:07 UTC]: I see. would you be able to transfer to some on in Fiori dev using visual studio code? Grahame@SAP [2021-06-10 12:22:22 UTC]: certainly this is what I am doing in the background looking for someone to transfer this to with the knowledge you require Vinodh Kumar [2021-06-10 12:22:32 UTC]: thank you!

Vinodh Kumar [2021-06-10 12:32:10 UTC]: Sure. VisualStudio code for developing fiori app. Vinodh Kumar [2021-06-10 12:32:25 UTC]: VisualStudio and BAS are two recommended tool. Vinodh Kumar [2021-06-10 12:32:29 UTC]: for fiori dev. Vinodh Kumar [2021-06-10 12:32:51 UTC]: will that information change on which team we need to reach out to?

Grahame@SAP [2021-06-10 12:43:09 UTC]: Just chatting with a member of the UI5 team, from their side they support webIDE and BAS. so because you are using VS i think the -NET component I was creating the incident under was right Vinodh Kumar [2021-06-10 12:44:11 UTC]: ok. great. do u think u will be able to transfer the chat to that group?

Hi,
Would it be feasible for you to upload your project(s) for review, this might provide some insight to your issue.
You can produce a zip with only the required files by running the following terminal command on Business Application Studio;
zip -r feproject.zip ./ / -x */\.* *.git \.* *.zip *.env* *.rb *.bak *.swp *.DS_Store *.back *.merge *.txt *.sh **/resources/\* **/mta-op-*/\* **/gen/\* **/node_modules/\* **/mta_archives/\* **/dist/\* **/.ABAPDeployResources/\* **/.vscode/\*
replace ./ /  with the path to your project i.e. /home/users/projects/myproject. Please upload the generated zip file(s).
This blog has the latest and recommended approach in producing an MTA using a shared reusable library, this was produced to allow customers to have a deeper understanding of  how to restructure their projects with different lifecycles supporting different individual projects https://blogs.sap.com/2022/02/08/designing-ui5-apps-for-sap-launchpad-service-part-2/. The comments section is also a great source of information of resolving known issues.
In the meantime, we will try to find the appropriate support component who can hopefully help you on your journey.

Hi Team, I had tried these blogs and couldn't get it working. They are year old as well. Things which i have tried: - Just to check if i can deploy the library and load it GitHub - lemaiwo/CFUI5ExampleLibrary: CF UI5 Library i have used the above source code and deployed and it letting me load the library using the path https://fonterracfdev.launchpad.cfapps.ap10.hana.ondemand.com/bewlexampleLibrary.bewlexamplelibrary/library-preload.js which might be okay. Now trying to get app to access this library when launched from the service. 1. Updated xs-app.json file to route requests tried various options: {      "source": "^resources/be/wl/examplelibrary/(.*)$",      "target": "/bewlexampleLibrary.bewlexamplelibrary/$1",      "service": "html5-apps-repo-rt",      "authenticationType": ""    }, and using library service { "source": "^/resources/bewlexamplelibrary/(.*)$", "target": "/$1", "destination": "com_balta_exampleLibrary_uaa_ExampleLibrary", "authenticationType": "", "csrfProtection": false } 2. Update manifest file along with url at the dependency libraries but didnt work,                "be.wl.examplelibrary": {                    "url": {                        "url": "/bewlexampleLibrary.bewlexamplelibrary/",                        "final": true                      },                      "lazy": false                } - noticed file ui5app.json file didnt respect the urls provided in manifest. please check the attachment. can this be forwarded to the app router/html5 application/launchpad service team?

Dear Customer,
Thanks for contacting SAP Product Support.
If you already have the application and the reuse library you can have 2 options currently.
1. Where you only want to change the application code.
In this case if the reuse library has been deployed to the backend system to the UI5 Application Index it will be loaded automatically using startup of the application preview (assuming it includes the file `webapp/utils/locate-reuse-libs.js`). The library must also be referenced in the manifest.json of the application in the `libs` section.
2. Where you want to modify the reuse library code.
clone both the application and the reuse library to the workspace.
Link the reuse library to the application via the command palette command "Add Reference to SAP Fiori Reusable Libraries". Then follow the wizard steps. Then during application preview the reuse library will be served from the workspace.

Solution provided: Dear customer,
I have discussed this internally, and there is currently no official guide on that topic from SAP. It depends on the concrete configuration/setup. My proposal would be to take the question about your test setup to the SAP Community (https://community.sap.com/) and utilizing the knowledge of the broad customer community. Please apologize that I don't have a direct answer for you.

Hi SAP Team, We are aware that SQLite or CSV Data helps serving the local testing (This is the basic steps explained in most of the SAP CAP Tutorials ) , but here the SAP UI5 Integration / Unit tests that we are writing will be executed by  pipeline. Will we still have the backend local server ( localhost:4004 ) up and running when the tests are invoked in pipeline ? We do not think that is the case. Please confirm. BR,  R. 2023-01-27 10:06:59 -  (D044415) (External Info)
Solution provided: Dear customer, update here. We recommend using the standard CAP server for Node.js (cds run/watch). This one is capable of loading csv data on the fly into an in-memory SQLite DB or to have csv data deployed explicitly into a persistent DB using `cds deploy`. See the tutorial for more.

Dear customer,
the  for OData V4 services on the open source repo https://github.com/SAP/open-ux-odata is currently not supporting CAP projects natively.

SAP Support 2023-01-25 11:02:21 -  (I330760) (External Info)
Hi ,

The development team have got back to me. It seems that the module sap/ui/core/util/ is only for OData V2. There is currently no dedicated  for OData v4.
Kind regards,

SAP Support 2023-01-25 10:38:53 -  (I556484) (Internal Info)
Hi ,
The customer is correct.
The module sap/ui/core/util/ (CA-WDE-MCK), which btw. is not actively developed anymore, is only for OData V2. There is currently no dedicated mock server for OData V4 from CA-UI5-COR.
I believe this case is rather for SAP Fiori tools (CA-UX-IDE) as they provide running UI5 apps based on OData mock via npm run start-mock according to Use Mock Data | SAP Fiori tools.

Hi  / Team, Attached the network trace. Basically we are trying to understand the feasibility of Creating  of a CAP Service oData V4 in SAP UI5 Freestyle application. The documentation mentioned in SAP UI5 help ( Which you also shared in this ticket ) does not help in this. Not sure of the meaning of the sentence mentioned in the document "The mock server functionality for oData V4 is included with CAP Node.js." but further not giving/referring anything related UI5 in CAP Cookbook. I would also like to share on the outcomes of other attempts we tried by ourself. Please feel free to correct the understanding of our attempt's outcomes. 1. When we tried with "oMockServer.simulate" of library "sap/ui/core/util/" it gave us invalid metadata error. We assume that this simulate syntax of this library is only applicable for V2 as we observed a parameter in request header of the metadata query MaxDataServiceVersion = 3.0. 2. We also think that there is no UI5 library available to generate mock server of oDataV4 , hence we should find different ways like customizing whole simulation ( Handling all kind of requests in a custom way ). BR,  R. 2023-01-24 08:34:18 -  (I330760) (External Info)
Hi ,

You are correct. However, I do not believe there is a guide that shows how the connection is set up. I would need to see the request in the network trace to look into this further.

Also, Do we have any documentation or working sample of SAP UI5 Freestyle Application using OdataV4  ? BR,  R. 2023-01-23 15:47:18 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi SAP Team, We already went through this but did not work for us. The documentation shows how to run the service using mockdata but the link we are missing here is how to connect with the UI5 App. When we invoke capservice from UI5 development localhost:4004 is not getting connected as cds server is not up and running. Is there a way to invoke localhost:4004 ( Which is part of capservice ) from UI5 developments ? BR,  R. 2023-01-23 10:29:29 -  (I330760) (External Info)

Hi , Not sure if this is what you are looking for, here are some steps that we documented to reuse/create an authentication service and a HTML5 repo service that can be reused by your FE applications; === Expose Application to Central Application Router Exposing an application to the central application router requires to create subaccount level destinations requiring the organization maanger authorizations. Open the SAP Cloud  Cockpit for your account. ==== Prepare Authentication Service. Open `Service Instances`. Select `Authorization & Trust Management`. Search for your XSUAA service e.g. type `test- `. Click on the `>` on the right side of the row containing your service. If there is no service key, create one (click on three dots in the upper right corner). Copy the name of a service key ==== Expose Authentication Service. Open `Connectivity` -> `Destinations`. Click on `New Destination`. Select 'Service Instance`. `Service Instance`: Select the XSUAA service created with your mta e.g. `test- -uaa`. `Name`: Give it a meaningful name e.g. `test- -uaa`. Click on `Next`. Click on `New Property` and add `ServiceKeyName` and paste the name copied before e.g. `test- -uaa-service-key`. Click on `New Property` and add `sap.cloud.service`: `test- `. Click on `Save` ==== Prepare HTML5 Repository Service. Open `Service Instances`. Select `HTML5 Application Repository`. Search for your service e.g. type `test- `. Click on the `>` on the right side in the row with the service with `Plan` `app-host`. If there is no service key, create one (click on three dots in the upper right corner). Copy the name of a service key ==== Expose HTML5 Repository  Service. Open `Connectivity` -> `Destinations`. Click on `New Destination`. Select 'Service Instance`. `Service Instance`: Select the HTML5 Repository service created with your mta e.g. `test- -html5-repo-host`. `Name`: Give it a meaningful name e.g. `test- -html5-repo-host`. Click on `Next`. Click on `New Property` and add `ServiceKeyName` and paste the name copied before e.g. `test- -deployer- -html5-repo-host-credentials`. Change the suggested property `sap.cloud.service` to `test- ` (same as for xsuaa service destination). Click on `Save` ==== Test Application. Open `HTML5 Applications`. Search for your app(s) `test- `. Click on your application `test modulename` ==== Enable integration into cFLP Open the `manifest.json` of your application and add the parameter below to the root node: ``` "sap.cloud": { "public": true, "service": "test-" } ``` Rebuild and deploy your mta project. **Note**: if you do not execute the steps above then you will be able to configure the application to work in cFLP but it will fail with an error when being loaded. 2021-03-29 21:44:48 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi , thanks. Just as a clarification for me: With "root MTA" you mean mta in one directory and all applications in a directory beneath it? If yes, I think this is not what I would desire since that would mean also a shared repo host, which I want to avoid, since I always would have to deploy all apps at once. I would desire one repo host per app and shared destination and uaa services. Regards,  2021-03-29 14:35:29 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi , Sorry you are experiencing these issues. I've asked our PO's to prioritise these so they are addressed in a future release. To address your comment about shared destination and uaa services, you have the option to create a root MTA using the steps detailed below. The following steps will allow you to generate FE applications which are appended to a root  mta thus sharing the ui5 destination and uaa services. Step1. Open the command palette `View` -> `Find Command` a. Enter `Open CF Application Router Generator `, entering a uniqie Id for `Enter MTA ID` that is unique within your organisation, select ` ` for `Add router module` Step2. Open the command palette `View` -> `Find Command` -> `Fiori: Open Application Generator` a. Create a `SAP Fiori application` b. Module name: uniquemodulename (make sure its unique in your organisation) c. Namespace: com.hostname / leave blank if not applicable d.  Select `Yes` to `Add deployment configuration`, ensuring the newly generated MTA file is selected e.  Select `Yes` to `Add FLP configuration`, refer to next step `` for input params, this is required for Launchpad to show your application tile  2021-03-29 14:33:44 -  (I313149) (Internal Info)

Hi , we need to deploy both to CF and to onpremise SAP Systems, therefore I am currently relying on the task webide-extension-task-updateManifestJson to make the manifest dataSources entries uris relative for CF Deployment.

Hi, Sorry for not responding sooner, I had to take some personal leave. Yes, ideally you would have a  mta config at root level and all new FE apps would hang off that. When you are creating a new FE app, you would reference this mta directory and the project would get appended to it and generated as a subfolder. As regards your deployment issue, yes it looks like a  naming issue. There is a github issue that has been assigned to me to resolve this as there are implications in shortening the name as you stated. To address some of your comments; 1. Yes both BAS and VSC should work the same 2. Two directory structure is not required, you can have a root mta config with all your FE apps hanging off them 3. I will do a followup response on shared destination and uaa services Your feedback is greatly appreciated so please feel free to reach out to me on *EMAIL* with any addtional feedback.  2021-03-22 09:46:30 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi, for pure deployment errors I have now created 196461 / 2021. Regarding length of service names: These are limited to 50 characters. The Fiori Tools creates a mta.yaml with longer entries. The deployment partly takes care of longer names and is shortening them, but this leads to further problem since the shortening is not applied everywhere and thus part of the deployment with fail because the prerequisites are not found. IMHO Fiori Tools should at least warn about the longer service names. IMHO there should be also an option to use preexisting destination and uaa services. Regards,  2021-03-19 17:38:05 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi, I tried now in VSC with the new version available. Unfortunatly this fails on deployment and I can't really see the cause. Deeper reason might be the  name but IMHO somehow there should be an (semi-)automatic handling of too  names. I have attached a zip with the error logs. Regards,  2021-03-18 17:04:56 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi, tried this first in my trial account to not mess up our normal account. Some remarks: - I originally wanted to try this in VSC and not in BAS, as your instruction are for BAS, i tried it there first - is this two-directory level structure really needed? With my VSC plugin try everything was in one directory. - Could I use shared destination and uaa service (one service each per app seems kind of "overkill")? - Running the deploy command gave at first an error: Operation ID: 15747579-87eb-11eb-a7a7-eeee0a81899d Deploying in org "eb64c683trial" and space "dev"...

Hi, Thank you for using our Fiori Tools, there are improvments coming in this weeks release around adding  to an existing FE application. The latest command `npx fiori add deploy-config cf` will allow you to add  to an existing app. However, I've documented these steps which will work with our existing release of Fiori Tools but again, with our next release alot of these will be obsolete as you will be able to add  support during the Fiori Elements wizard flow thus not requiring all the initial steps as shown below; Prerequisites 1. As SAP customer, you have purchased the Launchpad service to support FLP (not required otherwise) 2. Ensure you have the latest @sap/generator-fiori npm module installed 1. Create a new SAP Fiori Dev Space 2. Or In your existing dev space, update to the latest by running `npm i -g @sap/generator-fiori`, https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sap/generator-fiori for more info 3. Understanding  https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/appstudio-sapui5-create.html#5a114a0f-2e97-40cb-ba1c-8710e713a011 4.

If a UI5 destination is not exposed at sub-account level, update the resource ` -destination-service` to include the UI5 destination; - name: -destination-service type: org.cloudfoundry.managed-service parameters: config: HTML5Runtime_enabled: true version: 1.0.0 init_data: instance: existing_destinations_policy: update destinations: - Name: ui5 Type: HTTP URL: https://ui5.sap.com ProxyType: Internet Authentication: NoAuthentication service: destination service-name: -ui5-destination-service service-plan: lite 7. Integrate your SAPUI5 app into your launchpad site https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/cp-launchpad-integrate-sapui5-app.html Configuration Step1. Open the command palette `View` -> `Find Command` a. Enter `Wizard` and select `Open Template Wizard` b Select `Basic Multitarget Application` and press `Next` c. Enter a unique project name, unique within your organisation i.e. the name is used as MTA ID in the `mta.yaml` file **Note**: SAP Application Studio will restart itself with the new project as root folder Step2. Right click the newly generated `mta.yaml` and select `Create MTA Module from Template` a. Select ` Configuration` and press `Start` b. Select your HTML5 application runtime `` c. Enter a unique name for the business solution of the project | Enter a unique ID e.g. ` -service` from step 1.c d. Do you plan to add a UI? `Yes` Step3. Open the command palette `View` -> `Find Command` -> `Fiori: Open Application Generator` a. Create a `SAP Fiori application` b. Module name: uniquemodulename (make sure its unique in your organisation) c. Namespace: com.hostname d.  Select `Yes` to `Add deployment configuration`, ensuring the newly generated MTA file is selected, refer to next step `Target Name` e.  Select `Yes` to `Add FLP configuration`, refer to next step `` for input params, this is required for Launchpad to show your application tile Step4. Target Name a. Please choose the target - should default to Cloud Foundry b. Destination name: Keep selected destination, otherwise input a valid destination appropriate for your environment Step5.  a. Semantic Object - somename (should be a unique name for within your site) b. Action - display c. Title - My App Desc d. Subtitle - Fiori Rocks! Step6. Validate everything is working by right clicking on your new application and selecting `Preview Application` a. Ensure you are able to load and retrieve data Step7. Validate `sap.cloud` was added correctly to `webapp`-> `manifest.json`. If missing, append the following where the service is the id generated in step 2   "sap.cloud" { "public": true, "service": "-service" } Step8. Change into the root folder containing `mta.yaml`, run `npm run build` which will build the MTA archives Step9. In the same folder, run `npm run deploy` and your app should be deployed Step10. Before configuring a tile in cFLP, validate that the app has been successfully deployed. You can see all applications in the `HTML5 Applications` section in your sub account -> HTML5 Applications list Step11. Alternatively, from the command line, you can run `cf mtas` to see a list of all your HTML5 deployed applications with `sap.cloud.service` exposed, for more information https://help.sap.com/viewer/584e0bcbfd4a4aff91c815cefa0bce2d/Cloud/en-US/83b0fb23e37d456caad1ad0448e14727.html

The Layout Editor is a feature of SAP Web IDE which works in compatibility mode in SAP Business Application.
There is no concept of Project Settings as was in SAP Web IDE and therefore it's relevant only when working with Layout Editor in SAP Web IDE. You don't have the option to select UI5 libraries in BAS.

Your interaction with SAP Support Contact name:  Contact phone or email: *PHONE* Channel: Email Interaction summary: Hello
subject:  assign processor.  client need a  update
client is  mentioning that  we're starting to move our Developments from Web IDE to BAS. Unfortunately I run into the following problem when running: npm run deploy-config I've answered the questions in the following way: ? Please choose the target ABAP? Destination S4B_060_WEBIDE - http://bsh-s4b.bshg.com:12? Is this an S/4 Cloud system? No? Name (Maximum length: 15 characters) /BSH4/SLOWNONMOV Application name limited to 15 characters, entered 16 In Web IDE there was no issue deploying the app with this name. As you can see from the attached "Screenshot 2021-04-10 at 18.00.31.png" the BSP Container /BSH4/SLOWNONMOV is available in transaction SICF. To solve this issue I expect SAP to check for an entered customer Namespace (i.e. /BSH4/) and don't count this 6 characters.

Dear , yes, this is the workaround that I'm using since I've filed the incident. Best regards
 2021-05-24 20:50:51 -  (I829208) (External Info)
Hi ,
I suppose you are right. My initial tests validates your reported behavior. While we fix the issue, as a workaround, can you please do the following:
1. Run "npm run deploy-config"
2. Select ABAP (or run "npm run deploy-config abap directly")
3. Continue with your entries but when asked "name" provide a dummy name for now which is less than 15 chars.
4. Once the deployment config is generated, goto "ui5-deploy.yaml" and change the name manually under "app" to what you want.
5. Then run "npm run deploy"

Can you please confirm if you are able to deploy your application with the workaround for now?

Hi ,
Your ticket has reached SAP Fiori tools (CA-UX-IDE) and I will help you with your reported issue.
, I am assuming that url you are trying to reach is behind your corporate proxy. If yes then can you please do the following in VSCode:
- Open the VSCode settings and in the 'Search Settings' box type 'proxy'
- If you have not already got the environment variables 'http_proxy' or 'https_proxy' set, you can provide them in the 'Http:Proxy' input box
- There should also be a select box 'Http: Proxy Support'.  Please ensure this is set to 'on'
- Save these settings and restart VSCode and try again.

Please try and let me know if this fixes your issue?

Hey  App Preview works just fine locally. UI5 Version we are using for the template is 1.71.27 and our FES UI5 version is 1.71.27. I did not receive any email from you. I am open for a meeting anytime today to investigate the issue. Kindly advise. Regards  2021-04-28 21:46:10 -  (I829208) (External Info)
Hi ,

I had a look into your attachment and I don't think the issue is because of the possible code minification.
Can you please confirm if the App preview works for you locally. If yes, then whats the UI5 version difference?
I have also emailed you and we can have a meeting on this topic tomorrow to investigate it further.

Dear , We are not complaining about the reachability of certain resources, we are complaining because of Principal Propagation is not operating as expected after migration from WebIDE Full-Stack to SAP Business Application Studio. We currently set up two Destinations, RG3 with Principal Propagation and RG3_BASIC with Basic Authentication. When we try to access resources on the same system, with: 1) Refer to Error of RG3 Destination with Principal Propagation 021-05-31 14_20_08-Window.png RG3.txt 2) Working fine with RG3_BASIC Destination and Basic Authentication 2021-05-31 14_28_09-Basic.png RG3_BASIC.txt So, if we would have issues with certain resources it would not work either with RG3_BASIC Authentication. Related to your finding with https, this is how it is used and working with SAP Cloud Connector. Regs.  2021-06-14 10:37:48 -  (I335123) (External Info)
Hi , thanks for the information. Would it be possible to also share the Destination Configuration? The error you are seeing is usually because of misconfiguration. For example the service path should be exactly as specified by the backend system without redirects i.e. ensure that trailing '/' are included if required. Redirects are not followed when using destination lookups and so the path must match exactly the service path. Sometimes simply adding or removing the trailing '/' can fix this error. I also noticed that the host URL (http://redportdfsd.sap.redbull.com:443) is http but the port is 443. Is this correct? Shouldn't it be https?

Trying out this Cloud Foundry component to see if you might know who best to send this to.

Thank you so much for your response. Based on the links provided we have concluded that this is a connectivity issue between the BAS and the CC. We will close the ticket and review this in a different one. Thanks again! 2023-01-03 10:52:14 -  (I067928) (External Info)
Dear Customer,

Thank you providing the extra details, in the document “Error in BAS Part 2.docx”

So based on the 2 documents you have provided we believe your issue is not caused by Fiori Tools(CA-UX-IDE).

We believe there is an issue somewhere between the cloud connector and the on Prem system
It could be related to creating a secure connection from the CC to the OnPrem system, perhaps caused by a firewall or something

In the document : Error in BAS.docx, you ran an odata test & you ran this test over http, but we can see that the cloud connector is configured via https (see image 2 & 6)
We suggest that you:
1. enable logging on the cloud connector
2. re-run the odata test using https instead.
3. Then check the logs of the cloud connector, as there might be better error there that will identify the issue.

I would also suggest that you look at the following 2 documents, as they may help to solve your issue.
To confirm firewall issue https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2377425
Cloud connector : https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2930080

Solution provided: Customer was able to resolve their configuration issue.
Additional notes appended in a previous note to them regarding v2 and v4 odata differences.
 2022-08-18 13:02:14 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
Glad to hear everything got sorted.
Please revew to https://blogs.sap.com/2021/02/05/is-it-time-to-switch-to-odata-v4/ to understand the core differences between the two odata versions which in turn impact the templates that are supported in Fiori.
All the best on your project.
 2022-08-18 12:39:12 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi , The issue is resolved now, the configuration was executed in 500 client(Dev) it has to execute manually again in 100(QA) client which was not the case for V2 odata service. Thanks for all your efforts and help. We are good to close this incident now. Only one last question, why this template is restricted to V4 OData only and not available for v2? Regards  A 2022-08-17 19:03:36 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
Can you please complete the following two tasks;
1. Service Centre
In Business Application Studio, select the `Service Centre` tab on the left navigation bar, select your destination, if configured correctly, the service and system properties will be returned. Please ensure you have a V4 service exposed to validate the flow.
2. Environment Check
From Menu Options -> View command -> Find Command ->Fiori: Open Environment Check
Please review the output and attach the generated zip to the support ticket. If the v4 services are still not being returned, please refer to https://help.sap.com/docs/PLM_EPD/1bfdb8b2f0264b66a818a2a889ee8c31/1d655f0c0b8e4b5993b53881c0a202a5.html

Hi , I did the v4 service activation as suggested in blog suggested but still i am facing 403 error in BAS. Please suggest. Regards  A 2022-08-11 11:09:42 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Solution provided: Hi,
Thank you for taking the call today.
The issue with the 403 was related to the odata4 endpoint not being exposed on the gateway.
Two other issues were indentified but separate incidents will be reaised as they are unrelated to this issue.
I'm resolving the ticket, please reopen if you have any other issues with generating a V4 Fiori app using Fiori Tools. 2022-08-11 09:10:57 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi , I have sent invite for 4PM meeting. Regards  A 2022-08-11 08:41:05 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
Please email  and myself with a meeting invite for today to discuss these issues further.
However, based on the environment check output, you do not have v4 services exposed;

Details for `DS1-100`
✅   V2 catalog call returned 1672 services
🚫   V4 catalog service not available

You have an OnPremise destination DS1-100, so please ensure the path `/sap/opu/odata4/iwfnd/config/default/iwfnd/catalog/0002/ServiceGroups` is exposed.

Please refer to this help guide:
https://help.sap.com/docs/PRODUCT_ID/1bfdb8b2f0264b66a818a2a889ee8c31/1d655f0c0b8e4b5993b53881c0a202a5.html?state=PRODUCTION&version=Cloud&locale=en-US

This issue was also covered in a technical article on SAP blogs https://blogs.sap.com/2020/10/12/odata-v4-service-catalog/

Hi ,
We are getting error code 403 which means your user is unauthorized for the V4 catalog service ODATA path/url I had posted in my previous response. Whether you have active V4 service or not, I cannot tell as it catalog service request needs to get past authorization.
If issue persists, if you want, we can have a quick sync on this to answer your question and resolve yours issue faster, as I understand getting stuck in generator is a blocker for you. If its fine, then send en email to me and my colleague  and one of us will schedule a call based soon based on your time zone.

Hi , So you mean to say there are no active V4 service in system which is why we are getting this error? regards  A 2022-08-10 05:14:51 -  (I829208) (External Info)
Hi ,
Thanks for running environment check and it seems we do have a valid access issue as gathered by environment check tool too.
So to summarize to previous reply, you have the following option for creating Form Entry Object Page:
1. You need to make sure you have correct authorizations to access V4 catalog services.
http://DS1-100.dest/sap/opu/odata4/iwfnd/config/default/iwfnd/catalog/0002/ServiceGroups?$expand=DefaultSystem($expand=Services)&sap-client=100

2. If you cannot get option 1, then second option is to configure a FULL or PARTIAL service destination, which means from Fiori generator, you will use the Odata Service URL as data source, provided you have configured it correctly as discussed here: https://ga.support.sap.com/dtp/viewer/index.html#/tree/3046/actions/45995:48363:52803
PLease let me know if you need more clarification/help?

Regards,
 2022-08-09 11:21:44 -  (I057546) (External Info)
Hi,

Please ensure the user has the correct permissions to access the endpoint :

`'http://DS1-100.dest/sap/opu/odata4/iwfnd/config/default/iwfnd/catalog/0002/ServiceGroups?$expand=DefaultSystem($expand=Services)&sap-client=100' `

This is required to access the v4 services catalog.

As an interim workaround you may configure a full or partial service destination. Please see help docs: https://ga.support.sap.com/dtp/viewer/index.html#/tree/3046/actions/45995:48363:52803

Im not sure this is the right product component but it was not clear to me where to put this This worked fine before for multiple devs and multiple apps but it affects several apps and developers now. We have a custom library called eddiui5lib. This library is deployed on our FES. The lib is referenced in the dependecies section of manifest.json -> When starting the Apps in BAS using the Launch Configuration via index.html, the application will crash on load because it will tell us that the library could not be loaded -> When starting the apps in BAS using the Launch Configuration via flp, the library is correctly loaded and the app starts -> When starting the apps deployed on the system which also consume the library, it works fine as well Hence we assume it's not an issue with the library but with BAS. On a side node, several of our apps could not be run starting this week. In those apps, we had to run the terminal command "npm i @sap/ux-ui5-*EMAIL*" which fixed the issue. I'm not sure this is related but it strikes me as odd that these happened at the same time Please have a look or let me know if you have further questons

Solution provided: Hello ,
thanks for attaching the project. I can see that in the "index.html" the configuration for loading custom libraries is missing.
You need also the following script inside of the "index.html":

data-sap-ui-manifest-uri="./manifest.json"
data-sap-ui-componentName="de.edeka.rwws.eh.fr.regaleinteilung">

I attached a corrected version of the index.html. Please try with this one.

Hi Colleagues,

When the custom application is started from BAS using the Launch Configuration via index.html the on-premise library is not reachable.
The HTTP trace shows that entry:

The deployed application also can reach the on-premise custom library.
According to customer this issue started on the week 29.07.2022
Customer also reported that it happens with one old project, with newly created projects it does not happen:
"

Only the ones that are a couple months old are affected

"
Could you help further with this case, why the on-premise library is not reachable?

Hi, there is also a thing to add:

We are creating multiple applications and the ones that are recently created via the BAS template do not have this issue. Only the ones that are a couple months old are affected 2022-08-02 09:23:52 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi, first, thank you for answering so promptly! I have attached both network traces and an additional document with more information as well as the manifest.json file Regarding your question:"Is the eddiui5lib stored in on-premise system and can be accessed via an HTTP destination?" A: Yes it is deployed on-premise I have an additional thing to note. For the first time, i saw that in the non-working scenario, the $metadata call of our Backend-Service returns an error (no http response code), you can see that in the log. I would assume this is the issue, that in the not-working-scenario the backend connection doesnt work proply hence the library is not loaded. However the connection setup is correct because in the working scenario. So I assume this is an issue in BAS 2022-08-02 08:13:45 -  (I044540) (External Info)

Hi,
Making some progress, glad to hear.
Can you change the URL in the S4-HTTP-100 from port 8000 to 44300? It can still remain as http since the port will determine the port to connect to which based on your latest xls document, is configured for HTTPS.
Also, service centre is showing that V2/V4 endpoints are availabe but you have not exposed any services on them which is why the properties for the system are ONLY being returned. The service properties are not being shown as there are none available.
Please take a look at
https://blogs.sap.com/2019/03/27/how-to-guide-connectivity-setup-with-abap-and-sap-cloud-connector/
Under the heading `Expose Resources`. You need to ensure you are exposing the correct paths for your services.
Please let me know how you get on?

Hi,
Based on the latest attachment it seems that your cloud connector is still not configured correctly.
Here are some links to help;

sssumes you have exposed an ABAP catalog via your cloud connector. However,  if you have exposed a single service then the URL needs to be changed as follows;
sap/opu/odata/sap/My_Business_Service/$metadata
Where `My_Business_Service` should be updated to reflect the name of the backend service exposed via your cloud connector.
Please read the links referenced above to ensure you have connectivity to the backend services/catalogs. If you are unable to configure these components, please let me know and I can re-assign your ticket to the cloud connector team.

Dear ,
When I accessed the URL in step 11, I got a Gateway timeout error.
Also, in Business Application Studio, when I checked the destination in the "Service Center" tab in the left navigation bar, it is HTTP.
In Destination of BTP, the URL is "https://s4-sandbox:443" right after I press save, and it is set correctly.
However, when I reload the Destination, the URL becomes "http://s4-sandbox:443".
Is it possible to make an HTTPS connection from BTP to on-premises?
Screenshots are attached. File name : 20211206_1400.xlsx Best regards,  2021-12-03 13:47:24 -  (I313149) (External Info)

Hi,
Sorry to hear you are having these issues. To independently validate your destination configuration, follow these steps;
Note: Please ensure you have subscribed to the Launchpad Service before proceeding
1. In your SAP BTP Cockpit, select your subaccount overview page
2. Note the `Subdomain` attribute i.e. `my-name-company-dev`
3. Note the `API endpoint` attribute i.e. https://api.cf.eu10.hana.ondemand.com thus the region will be `eu10`
4. Select `Destinations` under `Connectivity` tab on the left navigation bar
5. Filter the destinations
6. Select your destination i.e. `MyDestination`
7. Select `Edit`
8. Set the following `Additional Properties`, if not already set;
HTML5.DynamicDestination: true
9. Select `Save`, please ensure you have the client secret if required
10. Generate the link as follows, replacing the four values as follows;
https://.launchpad.cfapps..hana.ondemand.com/dynamic_dest/ /
For example:
Single OData Service https://my-name-company-dev.launchpad.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/dynamic_dest/MyDestination/sap/opu/odata/sap/My_Business_Service/$metadata
OData Catalog V2
https://my-name-company-dev.launchpad.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/dynamic_dest/MyDestination/sap/opu/odata/IWFND/CATALOGSERVICE;v=2/ServiceCollection?%24top=1
OData Catalog V4
https://my-name-company-dev.launchpad.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/dynamic_dest/MyDestination/sap/opu/odata4/iwfnd/config/default/iwfnd/catalog/0002/ServiceGroups?$expand=DefaultSystem($expand=Services)
11. Open a new browser to validate the URL is working i.e. assuming its an OData Service, XML should be returned
Can you please report back what the outcome of these steps are?
Additionally, in Business Application Studio, select the `Service Centre` tab on the left navigation bar, select your destination, if configured correctly, the service and system properties will be returned. Can you please attach a screenshot of the output from the Service Centre?
Thanks.

Dear customer,
thank you reaching out to us. Based on the information that you've provided I can see that the application in question "zpur_vendor_maint" is using UI5 version 1.84.18. This version is outdated and it has been removed from UI5 CDN. You can find more about the removal of outdated UI5 versions in this blog post: https://blogs.sap.com/2021/01/26/removing-outdated-ui5-versions-from-ui5-cdn/.
For previewing application locally the following package is used https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sap/ux-ui5-tooling. Newer versions of this package will automatically detect if a version from UI5 CDN was removed and will automatically use the next highest patched version for the local preview. From your console log I can that this was not the case, so I assume that the application is using an older version of "@sap/ux-ui5-tooling". Would it be possible for you to update "@sap/ux-ui5-tooling"? If yes, please do one of the following solutions:

Solution 1 - By using the SAP Fiori tools (Preferred)
1. Open the command palette of VSCode / SAP Business Application Studio
2. Search for the command "Fiori: Open Application Info" and execute it
3. If you have multiple Fiori applications in your workspace, then select the application for which the "@sap/ux-ui5-version" needs to be updated
4. Once the "Application Information Page" is loaded, click on the action to update "@sap/ux-ui5-tooling" in the "Application Status" section
Solution 2 - Manually
1. Open the "package.json" of your Fiori application
2. In the "devDependencies" make sure that the version of "@sap/ux-ui5-tooling" is just "1".
3. Delete the "package-lock.json" file from your project
4. Delete the "node_modules" from your project
5. Run "npm install" in terminal in the root folder of your project (where the package.json is)

Product Area selected: SAP Business Technology Platform > Extension Suite - Development Efficiency > HTML5 Applications Component selected (Manual Selection): CA-UX-IDE --- Description --- Hello SAP Fiori Tools Team, it seems that the npm package @sap/ux-ui5-fe-mockserver-middleware is being replaced by @sap-ux/ui5-middleware-fe-mockserver. It would be great if this could be mentioned in the old package. Also the sample repository https://github.com/SAP-samples/fiori-tools-samples/ should be updated accordingly. There is already also an issue about this: https://github.com/SAP-samples/fiori-tools-samples/issues/13. Best Regards

Hello ,
Thanks for your input, the old package is consuming the open source one since 1.6.3 as not to break old usage. So while it is technically deprecated any consumer should still have the latest version on a fresh install.
You are of course right that there should be information about this on the package.
There should also be a depreciation notice in the latest version indicating what should be changed, along with a CLI to update your project automatically. As well as a change in the README file.
It does seem however that it was not released yet. I'll follow up on that to ensure this is done in the next release train.

Hi ,

Unfortunately the backend doesn't provide any information why it failed. But most likely there is conflict or duplicate project ids, manifest id, etc. Could you try to search for the ids etc you provided for the succeeded project, and check against why you use in the failed project? Please feel free to schedule a meeting with us to investigate together. But we would run the same trial and error procedure described above. 2021-09-03 02:39:36 -  (I829208) (Internal Info)
Hi ,
Due to my upcoming vacation, can you please take this issue forward. Now good news is that customer is able to deploy-redeploy new applications as of today.
They are left with couple of old projects which they want to redeploy. Here is my suggestion:
1. Remember you fixed the bug where because of changes folder deployment was returning 400. That fix should be out soon. So please take the customer's project, modify the script and ui=tool version and send it back to them to try.
2. One more possibility is ask them changing:
Goto your new project's webapp->manifest.json file and rename the sap.app->id to something different
And then trying to deploy again. That will make sure that a clean app id is being deployed to backend repository.

If neither of above works, then we need to get in touch with backend colleagues. Ping me before you do that please.

Thanks much.

Hi , For curl command, earlier I missed to replace the destination. Now, I ran the command again with correct values filled and got some response. I have attached the result file for your reference. Please check. Coming back to the re-deployment issue, I created a new project, deployed it (worked fine) and then re-deployed it (redeployment also worked). so, the re-deployment works fine for a new BSP application. But I still encounter the re-deployment issue with older BSP applications. I have attached the error details which I got during the re-deployment for an older BSP application.

Hello ,
Please see my last update carefully. It is expected that you replace the placeholders from the URL. Please do not use the example I had posted. Let me know if its clear?
I need one more help from your side. PLease follow these steps:
- Create a new Fiori project and generate the deployment configuration (I am assuming you have already done this so not detailing exact steps)
- Deploy
- Re-deploy (AT this point I am hoping that you see an error of duplicate ID)
- Goto your new project's webapp->manifest.json file and rename the sap.app->id to something different
- execute "npm run build"
- Then deploy again
What results do you get?
If you think you need more help with the instructions provided above, please let me know and we can have a quick meeting.

Can you do one quick test for me please?
Open SAP Business application Studio Open your dev space Open Terminal Execute the following command and hit enter and copy the result from the terminal and send it to me?

curl -u REPLACE_WITH_USERNAME:REPLACE_WITH_PASSWORD -v -i REPLACE_WITH_DESTINATION_NAME.dest/sap/opu/odata/UI5/ABAP_REPOSITORY_SRV/$metadata

So, if lets say my destination is names EC2 and my username is  and password is sap, this is how curl command will look like :

Hi ,
Thanks you for providing the log files.
Could you provide the ui5-deploy.yaml file.
The logs looks like you use the app name as "/RB41/SRVORDER_L3"
In this scenario, RB41 is the namespace and SRVORDER_L3 is the BSP application name.
Confirming for us the namespace, package, transport number will help with resolution.

Best regards,

Hello , i had a quick look.
Here is my recommendation:
Ask for ui5-deploy.yaml file OR at least the full snapshot.
From the initial logs looks like they are trying use the app name as "/RB41/SRVORDER_L3"
In this scenario, RB41 is the namespace and SRVORDER_L3 is the BSP application name.
SO confirming with them the namespace, package, transport number might help us/them in resolution. 2021-08-18 17:18:22 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)

Hi ,
Please provide the log output from /IWFND/ERROR_LOG (for the deploy step) as the status code of 400 is indicating that the Gateway has an issue with the requests.
There is also a note about ensuring that the anti virus scanner is setup as well in the trouble shooting section of:
A common issue is that during the setup, configuring a virus scan profile has been forgotten. This can be corrected in transaction /IWFND/VIRUS_SCAN.

Dear customer,
I checked the issue with our developer, from the logs you provided, it seems you are using abap-deploy command from BAS. This command is deprecated and not supported anymore.
In order to deploy an application from Business Application Studio to ABAP system, our recommendation is to use "deploy" command as specified here: here:https://help.sap.com/viewer/17d50220bcd848aa854c9c182d65b699/Latest/en-US/1b7a3be8d99c45aead90528ef472af37.html

Dear customer,
the issue was forwarded to development support, and we are investigating. An intermediate result is that when the preview is started with a lower UI5 version 1.96.9 the problems seem to not happen anymore.
To try this, please:
1. open the ui5.yaml file in your project's root directory
2. go to line 20, and add the mentioned version, i.e. "version: 1.96.9"
Then try preview again.

Expert Area: SAPUI5 Component: CA-UI5-COR I earlier had a chat over here regarding the same issue (Facing issues while deploying Fiori/UI5 app) and as a solution I was provided with this tutorial/blogpost - https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/abap-environment-deploy-cf.html . In this the data source selected is "Connect to a system" and then "" is selected as a system. However, what I did is that I selected OData as a data source and then followed further steps as mentioned in the tutorial but couldn't deploy the app. Is my method of choosing the data source correct or should I follow any other method? And if there's any workaround to perform the same without selecting the  then please help me with that. Created from Bold360 Chat. Additional Information:

I followed the instructions as given during the session. The destinations remain unchanged, it was explained during the session that although there's an issue with the catalog destination, using the partial url destination would resolve the issue for the time being. However, in order to check that I created an app in BAS using "Connect to a System" as the data source, it still gives the $metadata error (even while running and testing the app in the Business Application Studio) and service url mentioned in the manifest.json file is correct.
On the other hand if I use the "Connect to an OData Service" as a source and put in the username and password, then the application shows the data, but in that case data won't be visible post deploying the app to cloud foundry.
If correct authentication is provided for the partial url destination and if the data source uri in manifest.json is also now correct shouldn't it be showing the data in the Business Application Studio to the least? 2022-08-19 10:20:09 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Solution provided: Hi,
Another screen sharing session finished Aug 19th 2022.
Three issues found;
1. The previous working destinations had been misconfigured with the incorrect username/password and URL path, these had previosuly worked but were changed recently, both destinations are now working as expected
2. An existing freestyle application was configured with an incorrect service in the manifest, explained the change required to resolve the issue when deployed to CF
3. V2 catalog not showing any services, the issue is the V2 catalog does not contain any services. Customer is to followup with their contact who configured the COM_0106 user to request access to the V2 catalog and to ensure their CDS views/services are appended to the catalog.
Both Service Centre and Fiori Tools are working as expected, there is a some knowledge gaps around destination configuration and writing custom Freestyle apps.
Please refer to https://ga.support.sap.com/dtp/viewer/index.html#/tree/3046/actions/45995:48363:52803 for more information around partial URLs.
Another link that would be suitable to understand Freestyle apps is

 2022-08-19 10:09:30 -  (I313149) (Internal Info)
Customer is trying to retrieve a V2 catalog using a com user which does not have access.
A previous call with the customer resolved these issues but the customer changed the configuration and was again using the incorrect username/password to retrieve their odata service.
The work around is to create a partial URL destination. The customer was able to generate a Fiori app using this flow.
Also, the customer had a FF app but had incorrectly configured the datasources in the manifest thus when the app was deployed to CF, the odata service was not able to be retrieved. I explained the fix and why this was happening.
At this stage, it seems to be a knowledge issue with the customer. The Fiori Tools and deployment all work as expected.
This is not a high issue as they are only blocked by their knowledge around Fiori.

Hi,
My aplogies, it was a national holiday in Ireland on Monday August 1st.
As regards your issue with retrieving the catalog request, please be aware this is not a Fiori Tools related issue. You will need to speak with the team responsbile for configuring your technical user to verify if the catalog request is available i.e.
curl -v -i $H2O_URL/destinations/my311891/sap/opu/odata/IWFND/CATALOGSERVICE;v=2/ServiceCollection?%24top=1
If this path is not exposed or if services are not appended to it, then your only option is to use the partial URL destination which is configured already and should be working as expected.
If you want a followup call please email *EMAIL* with meeting details.

Dear , Greeting of the day ! I would like to tell you that our S4/HANA version is 2202 public cloud. The URL for S4/HANA Public cloud and BTP URL publicly exposed and we can access them any where from any network. We are using S4/HANA Technical user in our BTP destination. Please arrange a meeting on Monday to resolve the issue on priority. Best Regards,  *EMAIL* 2022-07-28 08:26:11 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
For the catalog request ensure the destination has the correct user/pass details.
Something must have changed as during our call, the V2 catalog was returning an empty list whch is why the Service Centre correctly showed the v2 status as available and Fiori Tools was showing an empty service list. Again, I would speak to your IT admin to ensure the V2 catalog is exposed for you.
 2022-07-28 05:53:54 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi, Both of the curl commands for testing partial url didn't give any error. But the other one to test the catalog endpoint gave "No authorization to access service" error. No changes were made on the ABAP backend either, I've asked the admin to append the service to the catalog, if the issue still persists after that I'll update here. 2022-07-27 13:23:29 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,

Hi,
To confirm the SAP BTP destinations are working as expected, re-run the curl commands that were provided during our session.
Also, here is the v2 catalog request;
curl "$H2O_URL/destinations/my311891/sap/opu/odata/IWFND/CATALOGSERVICE;v=2/ServiceCollection" -vs > curl-v2catalog-output.txt 2>&1
Open the respective txt files generated to review the returned XML responses, there should be no errors in each of the response.
Has anything changed on your ABAP backed? We had talked about contacint your admin and asking them to append the YY1 service to the catalog?
As regards the service centre flow, you might need to append a trailing forward slash i.e. YY1_YY1_CDS/ to the service name. Based on the attached screenshot, you might need to play with the service path i.e. YY1_YY1_CDS/  | /YY1_YY1_CDS/ | /YY1_YY1_CDS.
 2022-07-27 06:31:30 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi, Thank you  for all your help yesterday, things are clear than before. The user and password that we set in both the destinations were working fine and didn't give any error until now. On clicking on the destinations under Service Center in business application studio an authentication error pops up, screenshots are attached. I'm sure that after the session yesterday I didn't commit any changes to the configurations that were done. 2022-07-26 15:01:43 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Solution provided: Hi,
The issue here was related to the existing destination my311891 which is exposing a catalog of services. V2 is exposed but v4 is disabled. However, the root cause for this destination was the v2 catalog was empty. This prevented the user from being able to select a known service.
The solution was to clone the existing my311891 destination and create a partial destination. This would allow the user to enter the specific service during the Fiori tools wizard flow.
There was also an issue with the default COM user details which was causing HTTP 403 responses. Again, this was resolved when the correct user/pass were entered.
 2022-07-26 13:06:29 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)

 2022-07-26 12:09:20 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi , Thank you for providing us with such an articulated answer. I have added both of the destinations, in BAS the "Service Actions" button remains greyed out. I have attached the screenshots. As the V4 catalog service is not being returned, you may please guide us in adding it. 2022-07-26 10:25:02 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi, I've reviewed your attachments and here is my summary; 1. WebIDEAdditionalData is set to full_url, if this property is set, then you need to provide the full URL path to the exact service being exposed i.e. https://my311891-api.s4hana.ondemand.com/sap/opu/odata/sap/YY1_YY1 which also returns the metadata for the service https://my311891-api.s4hana.ondemand.com/sap/opu/odata/sap/YY1_YY1/$metadata 2. Trustall is set to true, what is the reasoning behind this? 3. WebIDEUsage odata_gen means you are exposing a single odata service via your URL endpoint 4. WebIDEUsage odata_abap means you are exposing a catalog of odata services via your URL endpoint 5. You created a Fiori app using an odata service URL and then used the my311891 destination as the Cloud Foundry (CF) target system 6. The Env Check results are showing that V4 catalog of services is not enabled thus Fiori Tools will not be able to retrieve all the services for you. Based on these points, you have created a mix of properties that are not aligned correctly. You have a few options: 1. I would undeploy the existing app on CF since this is misconfigured and will require additional changes to both the xs-app.json and to the my311891 destination. You can cd into the root of your project and run the command `npm run undeploy` 2. Create two destinations a. create my311891-partialurl with the following properties Description=Your Desc Type=HTTP HTML5.DynamicDestination=true Authentication=BasicAuthentication WebIDEUsage=odata_gen Name=my311891-partialurl WebIDEEnabled=true ProxyType=Internet URL=https://my311891-api.s4hana.ondemand.com/sap/opu/odata/sap/ Using these properties, you will be able to use Fiori Tools to retrieve services exposed at path `/sap/opu/odata/sap/` as it will prompt you for the name of the service during the wizard flow. b. create my311891 as a catalog of services Description=Your Desc Type=HTTP HTML5.DynamicDestination=true Authentication=BasicAuthentication WebIDEUsage=odata_abap,dev_abap,ui5_execute_abap Name=my311891 WebIDEEnabled=true ProxyType=Internet URL=https://my311891-api.s4hana.ondemand.com odata_abap → /sap/opu/data to access OData services of the SAP system dev_abap → /sap/bc/adt to be able to deploy into the SAP system’s SAPUI5 repository ui5_execute_abap → /sap/bc_ui5_ui5 to be able to execute SAPUI5 applications from the SAPUI5 repository This will create a catalog destination but will fail in Fiori Tools as the V4 services are not being returned. However, another option to create a Fiori app is to select the `Service Centre` tab on the left navigation bar, select your destination my311891, if configured correctly, the service and system properties will be returned for the V2. This will also allow you to create a Fiori application by clicking Service Action from this tool. I hope this resolves your issue.  2022-07-26 08:43:44 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)

Hi, Thank you for your prompt response. Please check the attached screenshots. 2022-07-25 06:16:58 -  (I328175) (External Info)
Dear customer,

Firstly,  please create a destination and point to the S/4HANA Cloud system in BTP.
Secondly, In the 5th Step point 4, please select "Connect to system" then select this destiantion, then select the relevant odata service.
If you still get error, please take screenshot for above two steps.

Best regards, 
SAP Support 2022-07-25 05:46:49 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
If this is the OData url - https://my311891-api.s4hana.ondemand.com/sap/opu/odata/sap/YY1_YY1_CDS Is this the correct way of pointing it to the destination - https://my311891.dest/sap/opu/odata/sap/YY1_YY1_CDS/ because I'm getting an error "Not valid url" with this one, however above one is working fine. 2022-07-25 00:23:03 -  (I328175) (External Info)
Solution provided: Dear customer,

From the screnshot, the URL to the odata is a direct URL to the S/4HANA Cloud system, could you please create a destination and point to the S/4HANA Cloud system in BTP and select this destination in the 5th Step point 4.

Best regards,

Hi, I have followed all of the steps mentioned in the blog, the only thing different I did is that in the 5th Step point 4, instead of the  service I have used OData service. Now, the situation is that the app is visible in the HTML5 Applications section (in this area when I run the app by clicking on the app name it gives a metadata error, screenshot of which is present in the attached document) and even in the Content Explorer section and I want to take it to the launchpad as a tile. Please check the attached document showcasing the steps I took to deploy the app. 2022-07-22 07:33:10 -  (I328175) (External Info)
Dear customer,

As discussed over the chat, please follow the blog to deploy the apps, if you get any eror, please provide a screenshot:

I earlier had a chat over here regarding the same issue (Facing issues while deploying Fiori/UI5 app) and as a solution I was provided with this tutorial/blogpost - https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/abap-environment-deploy-cf.html . In this the data source selected is "Connect to a system" and then "" is selected as a system. However, what I did is that I selected OData as a data source and then followed further steps as mentioned in the tutorial but couldn't deploy the app.
Is my method of choosing the data source correct or should I follow any other method? And if there's any workaround to perform the same without selecting the  then please help me with that. @SAP [2022-07-22 05:08:58 UTC]: hi @SAP [2022-07-22 05:09:06 UTC]: let me review the issue  [2022-07-22 05:09:52 UTC]: Sure. @SAP [2022-07-22 05:11:01 UTC]: is there any error ? @SAP [2022-07-22 05:13:40 UTC]: https://blogs.sap.com/2020/10/30/sap-business-application-studiobas-deploy-ui5-application-to-server/ @SAP [2022-07-22 05:13:50 UTC]: could you please follow this blog to deploy the app? @SAP [2022-07-22 05:14:05 UTC]: if there is any error message , please let me know  [2022-07-22 05:17:04 UTC]: In this blog again the blog is being deployed to the Abap server, is there any other way to deploy the app?

Hi,
I've reviewed your ticket and there are a number of items to note:
1. The check connection button associated with your destination on SAP BTP cockpit, does not validate a full end to end connection. This just ensures the connection is alive and responding. Remember, your Authnetication type is configured with BasicAuthentication which hasnt been validated.
2. When reviewing the environment check output, the following exceptions are being thrown when the secure connection is being created between your cloud connector and onpremise system;
Request to URL:  failed with message: write EPROTO 140266422450112:error:1408F10B:SSL routines:ssl3_get_record:wrong version number:../deps/openssl/openssl/ssl/record/ssl3_record.c:332:. Complete error object: Error: write EPROTO 140266422450112:error:1408F10B:SSL routines:ssl3_get_record:wrong version number:../deps/openssl/openssl/ssl/record/ssl3_record.c:332:
This indicates and issue with the SSL connection between the Cloud Connector and your onpremise backend. This could be a cloud connector configuration issue where you are mixing ports i.e. if your aim is to send plaintext on the 443 port, but the port is normally dedicated to HTTPS traffic when such an error will be thrown. You need to ensure the HTTP protocols match on the ports and paths being exposed. For example, you have the URL in your destination defined as http://vhmydds4ci.sap.mylabglobal.com:8000 soo please ensure if you have this mapped to a HTTP port rather than a HTTPS port since its not expecting it.
Please review your cloud connector settings;

I close the incident because we could fix the latest issue detected (see also ticket 190767/2023 (P1) - Error 404). The F4D issue is not related to the same project (My Time) but to a different system (MDT). Another ticket has been opened by that team to follow their incident. Thank you again to all the SAP support team for your help Best regards  2023-03-08 20:09:16 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi I sent the recommandation about the F4D issue to the right team (Engie MDT). About the 2nd issue (error 404) I have created a new incident as requested (190767/2023 (P1) - Error 404 during project deployment to ABAP Repository). Thanks and regards 2023-03-08 18:55:02 -  (I530828) (Internal Info)

Hi,
If 404 is still being returned and you have activated the required services, I would suggest opening a new issue against the support component CA-UI5-COR. Please refer to https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2999557 for more information in relation to the category and component. You can tag this support ticket for reference.
My apologies for this but unfortunately, Fiori Tools does not have the technical knowledge to debug this further.

Hi,
Sorry, I think there is some confusion in the previous request.
Just to be clear; the current API flow is as follows;
BAS Proxy -> SAP BTP -> SAP Cloud Connector ( Virtual Host to Internal Host Mapping running on an internal system) -> onpremise ABAP host system
The request is to run the curl commands against the ABAP host so that it hits the ABAP system directly, bypassing the SAP Cloud Connector. This is to validate the API requests are working as expected, for example, they are returning the V2 catalog request and eliminates any issues with any of the hosted SAP components i.e. BAS | SAP BTP or SAP Cloud Connector. We can then work backwards to determine which component is not configured correctly!
The host used in the screenshots is using the BAS instance and is hitting the cloud connector host/port which is why you are seeing the tunnel exception, this is the same issue you are having with the SAP BTP destination.
Also, the curl command where you have supplied the username and password seems to be incorrect. I incorrectly typed the word curl twice. The correct command is;
curl -u : -L "https:// : /sap/opu/odata/IWFND/CATALOGSERVICE;v=2/" -vs > curl-v2catalog-output.txt 2>&1
Can you please re-run these commands with the host address and port that is hosting the ABAP system and not the SAP Cloud Connector instance or any of the other SAP hosted products?  Remember, the issue is between the SAP Cloud Connector and your onPremise ABAP system. If your onPremise ABAP system is protected by a firewall/proxy then you need to speak to your IT Admin team to support this connectivity, it might require a change to the ports or whitelisting IP ranges to allow the connection from SAB BTP.
The curl commands will provide more information to you, whether the ports/hosts/ABAP system is configured correctly and responding to API appropriately. You can review the output files from these commands to understand more how the ABAP system is responding, again, you might need to involve your IT Admin to debug any of the exceptions that might be logged. If these commands are not working, then the SAP Cloud Connector will not work correctly either which is why we need to work backwards!
Please let me know if you have questions.

Thank you for your feedback. We are checking the connexion issue you have detected. Regards 2023-03-07 16:59:21 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
I've reviewed the logs and determined its a connection issue between your SAP Cloud Connector (SCC) and your internal host. Based on the logs it seems you are running a cache proxy and the error being returned is HTTP 403 which can relate to either where the connection is orginating from i,e, the IP range is not white listed or there is an issue with the username/password;

If you running windows, you can try using POSTMAN. The reason for not using your browser tab is it handles redirects/cookies etc differently.

Hi  & , Logging & Tracing the started app from BAS is quite difficult as the F12 Developer Tool in Google Chrome is not enabled directly but a few seconds after the start. I will check and test again a second trial this afternoon but according to me I saved the logs & traces as usual using Developer Tools > . I have a quick question, are these adaption projects original or just extensions of these apps? Concerning the MyTime scope: We have 3 extensions of Standard Fiori Apps:
My Inbox My Leave Requests (Version 3/Fiori 2.0) Approve Leave Requests (Version 3/Fiori 2.0)
And 15 custom Fiori Apps. regards,  2023-03-07 10:23:46 -  (I330760) (External Info)

Hi ,

Thanks for providing the attachments and logs. Could you provide a zip of the full project files by following these steps:
- Open command palette from taskbar in BAS
- Run command 'Fiori: archive project' and select the leave request app.
Then attach the zip to the ticket, this will include all app files needed to start it and I can review it.

Solution provided: Hi ,
This is  with the UI5 team and I don't have very good news here. You have already seen KBA 3117819 and 3232527 which detail the issue.  The HCM teams did not code their applications to be able to work with BAS so the only solution is to use .   I really cannot help at all here, as those app teams will have to change their apps to conform.
This should have been something the app team is aware of.
How else can I assist here?
Please let me know

Hi ,
About the topic "Migration from SAP Web IDE to BAS for standard fiori application extension", as mentioned in the sap note mentioned before, not all the standard fiori apps are supported and also about the troubleshooting is under different fiori app type support team.

Currently you reported issue is about the HCM related app, for example: My Leave Request, so we handover this ticket to PA-FIO-LIB component following the sap note you found.

Hi ,
understand your concerns. The helper file "changes_loader.js" which has the old faulty version parsing code is only used for app preview inside the development environment. It has no productive use, when the app is deployed.
Looking at the attached app, I can see that the "dist" folder which contains the to be deployed artefacts doesn't even contain the file, nor the whole "test" folder where it resides.
Would that help you to get the change through?
Unfortunately there is no fix, which doesn't require a change to a file in the applications. The problem's cause is that the old parsing code for the SAPUI5 version in "changes_loader.js", which is used for preview, is failing on UI5 versions >= 1.100. Hence one other but less optimal option would be to hard code a SAPUI5 version <1.100 into each app's ui5.yaml. The yaml files are also not used for production and are not deployed.
To repeat, the changes required don't affect productive code.
Best regards,

Hi , The issue not that we are from Pharma industry where it is not easy to change the apps and push to git without any change control. In order to change the 200 apps we need to raise several change requests , get them approved , implement the suggestion you mentioned push to git, deploy to test system , execute test cases and deploy to production system. This whole exercise takes nearly 3 months!. Is there any way to consider the latest change done in UI to downward portable? Thanks and Regards,  2022-05-23 13:19:23 -  (I520232) (Internal Info)

Hi ,
talked with the team and we found a solution how to mass change the version check in the changes_loader.js files for your projects, using the search & replace function of BAS.
Go to the search view in BAS In the search field type parseFloat(sap.ui.version) >= 1.8 In the search field select Match Case & Match Whole Word In the replace field type parseInt(sap.ui.version.split('.')[0], 10) >= 1 && parseInt(sap.ui.version.split('.')[1], 10) >= 80 In the files to include field type changes_loader.js Click on Replace All next to the replace field
See also the screenshot attached. This works for all app in the opened workspace. Please confirm whether this solves the issues for you.
Thanks and best regards,

Hi , Thanks for the recommendation but unfortunately we have nearly 200 apps where its not easy for us to change each app manually. Why this change and impact was not communicated to customers well in advanced rather than we need to struggle and spend time investigating ourselves several days before raising the incident? Thanks and Regards,  2022-05-20 14:15:57 -  (D044415) (External Info)
Solution provided: Dear customer,
the reason why the preview fails with version 1.100.0 is because of an issue in the ".../webapp/test/changes_loader.js" file in regards to the parsing of the UI5 version. This issue is fixed in newly generated applications, but there is no automatic procedure for older applications. The solution is to exchange the "changes_loader.js" file in your application with the one attached to this ticket. Hope this resolves the issue with preview with newer UI5 versions for you.
Best regards,

Hello SAP, In the call with the help of  and  we found that app is loading with lower version(1.99.3) of SAPUI5 and not with latest version(1.100.0 and above).
We were able to run the app using below options. 1)Run Configuration Go to Run configurations->Advanced Settings->SAPUI5 Runtime Settings-> UI5 Version (1.99.3)
2)Preview Application In ui5.yaml add SAPUI5 version as below- ui5: path: - /resources - /test-resources url: https://ui5.sap.com version: "1.99.3" However, if we create new app it works as expected and we see that in ui5.yaml file 'version' parameter is missing. But, in older apps it is present with blank value(version="") which means it picks up the latest version and app is not loading Regards,  2022-05-19 14:01:11 -  (I022947) (Internal Info)
The version tag "" exists in UI5 yaml thus all the apps fail in preview
I advised to create a run config with specific version.

In the trace, when this is getting called, the result is net::ERR_ABORTED.

Hi customer,

Sorry to hear you are having an issue still, even after the deployment succeeded.

Can I please confirm the following:

1. Your application previews successfully in BAS and deploys successfully.
2. The deployed application launches, but this error appears in the console.

Is that correct?  Could you please provide a full stack trace or screenshot of the error and the steps that lead to the 502 error?  This will greatly help determine what team can support in resolving it.

Thanks,

Hello customer,

We have been investigating the issue internally again.  The SAP infrastructure issue that has now been resolved may have stopped your application from redeploying.  Therefore, can you please try `npm run deploy` as you did originally?  It may work now that the infrastructure bug is resolved.

If you still get the same error, please provide a contact email address and I can set up an MS teams conversation for tomorrow.  Please also mention your timezone so that we can find a time that suits.

Regards,

2022-10-20 15:51:57 -  (I305274) (External Info)
Hi customer,
The second undeploy log details you provided seems to show output from a cloud foundry deployment, whereas the original deployment was for ABAP.  Can you please confirm this is an ABAP deployment you are attempting?

Can you please do the following:

In the root of your Fiori project, execute `npm run undeploy`.  You should not need to use `npx`.  For this to work, please ensure that you have a package.json in the Fiori project that contains the `undeploy` task.

If this fails to work, please paste the full terminal output, including your command, so that we can see what was being executed.

Secondly, please provide a copy of your Fiori project for review.  You can do this by selecting `Fiori: Archive Project` from the command palette in BAS.

Regards,

The intermittent issue with error 500 has now been resolved.  Can you please try and undeploy and redeploy again?  If it doesn't work, please provide some details on the log messages received so that we can help diagnose the issue.

Hi ,

Unfortunately there is also an existing issue with infrastructure with some of the BAS landscapes, where internal error 500 messages are being returned from metadata calls intermittently, affecting both deployment and launching the application.

Can you please let me know if the re-deploy issue is resolved with the workaround below?  You may have to try a couple of times due to the 500 error above.

Regards,

Hello ,

I am from the Fiori tools team, hopefully I can help resolve your issue.  Sorry to hear you are having a problem with re-deploying from BAS.  We have identified this as an issue with our tooling and are actively working on a fix.  There are a couple of workarounds you can do in the meantime:

1. You can undeploy and then re-deploy your application by doing the following:

In the root of your Fiori project, execute: npm run undeploy
This should undeploy the existing application.  You can then run:
npm run deploy

to deploy it again.

2. Otherwise, you can use /UI5/UI5_REPOSITORY_LOAD to directly upload your application.

Hopefully that works for you.

Regards,

2022-10-20 04:51:36 -  (I530262) (Internal Info)

Hi,
Here is a better link around Launchpad service that might suit your needs;
https://developers.sap.com/mission.cp-starter-digitalexp-portal.html
 2022-05-19 08:26:20 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
Here is a link to a more indepth resource around Launchpad Service;
https://help.sap.com/docs/Launchpad_Service/8c8e1958338140699bd4811b37b82ece/3a0e6d6b791c4c2189f6a0a424188362.html
If you have deployed your app to the Launchpad service i.e. if you login to your SAP BTP subaccount, select HTML5 applications, you should see the benefitsandrefunds app listed. Now, when you open your launchpad Site and refresh your content under Content Provider, do you see the app listed then in Content Explorer?
 2022-05-19 07:56:39 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi , If I understand them correctly, this is not a bug. It is a desired behavior. OK
but why can't I find the deployed app in my Launchpad service in the appropriate Space?
Do I have to add all these customizations in the tutorial you linked to each app myself in the future? Or will this be handled by the wizard in the future?
I tried to follow the instructions in the tutorial. Unfortunately, I could not get it to run. What exactly do I have to do in the case of the app benefitsandrefunds to see the app in the launchpad?
best regards 
2022-05-18 14:00:06 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
Sorry, I thought I had responded with an update.
The latest app benefitrefunds is correctly configured. Up until recently, the webapp/index.html did contain the FLP shell/tile but it was removed. Only test/flpSandbox.html file contains the flp for local preview support. It is assumed that when deploying to cFLP using your managed approuter setup, you will be adding your app to an existing FLP setup thus the shell/tile is obsolete.
I can refer to this blog, "Configure the Launchpad" to help with loading the particular tile in cFLP; https://answers.sap.com/questions/13234140/sap-cap-fiori-app-config-to-existing-flp.html
As regards local preview and based on your script start_dev, this will load the dist/root folders of the generated Fiori apps referenced under your apps folder. Previosuly, you would have selected the tile and launched your app this way. With this change, your app is loaded directly as the tile is removed.
The reason the shell component 'sap-ushell-config' was removed from the index.html was customers have their own FLP configured on Launchpad service and the sandbox platform which exposes the sap-ushell-config is restricted to development or demo use cases and must NOT be used for productive scenarios.
So I think this is a change in behaviour rather than an issue around incorrect configurations.
Please let me know if you need further clarification on this topic.

Hi, are there any news on this topic? best regards  2022-05-06 13:20:12 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
I've rebuilt your application and I understand your issue.
I need to investigate further what is happening here.
Sorry for the inconvenience caused.
 2022-05-06 10:21:58 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi , the Problem is that 2 Weeks ago the generator generated a working app with Fiori launchpad configuration. And i could test this in local mode within BAS without deployment. Now the generator does not generate a working Fiori launchpad configuration. I do not think that this is a problem on my side. And i can reproduce this behavior. if you start the application within BAS using the start-dev script. you will see the difference between benefitrefunds and all other apps. I thin the wizard do have a bug. If you are not able to reproduce the issue. I can show you. Best regards  2022-05-05 08:59:20 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
I've looked at your attached CAP project and I can see the benefitrefunds project has the FLP inbound navigation added correctly i.e.
"crossNavigation": { "inbounds": { "benefitrefunds-inbound": { "signature": { "parameters": {}, "additionalParameters": "allowed" }, "semanticObject": "benefitrefunds", "action": "display", "title": "{{flpTitle}}", "subTitle": "{{flpSubtitle}}", "icon": "" } } }

So the issue is related to how the app is deployed and picked up by the launchpad service.
From looking at your mta and project configuration, everything looks good.You are using a CAP project exposed using a standalone router and Fiori apps using a managed approuter. I'm assuming the destination used in the Fiori apps xs-app ntv_database is exposed at subaccount level as I dont see this in your mta.yaml configuration.
If you want to use an instance based destinaton for this flow, please refer to this blog post https://blogs.sap.com/2022/02/10/build-and-deploy-a-cap-project-node.js-api-with-a-sap-fiori-elements-ui-and-a-managed-approuter-configuration/
Please ensure you have completed the necessary configurattions to append the Fiori apps to the launchpad service, please refer to this help guide;

Hi ,
There is an option "Add FLP" in the App Generator wizard that needs to be checked. Please make sure that you have checked it, while generating your app.
You can also do this manually, after generation is finished:
In the command-line, `cd` to the root of the Fiori app Run the following command: npx -p @sap/ux-ui5-tooling fiori add flp-config
See this help video for more info: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbrwbFtaZak&t=2062s

Hello ,

Good day to you. My name is  and I was assigned to handle the incident.

--Symptom--
since today a new generated Fiori-Elements Application based on a CDS Service within BAS does not create a working FLP configuration anymore. Apps generated two weeks earlier have a working configuration. So after deployment of the newly generated application there is no Fiori tile visible in the launchpad service. Earlier generated apps does have a tile in launchpad. We saw that current changes to the generator have been made. For example the content of the manifest.json, the ui5.yaml is different to previously generated apps.
--Next Action--
For the mentioned symptom, I have researched internally. But could not find any similar case. Would you please help send us following information thus we can investigate further? 1. So since 4/29 you notice the issue, am I right? 2. Help share the archive newly generated and the archive which generated 2 weeks ago. We want to compare the archive and to see exact difference. 2. For newly generated application, even if you could not see the relevant tile after deployment, then are you able to see the application under Launchpad Site Manager -> Content Manager -> Content Explorer? If you can see it, are you able to add into Launchpad correctly?
Best regards,

Dear Fiori Tools colleagues,
The customer is trying to deploy the application from BAS by executing task: npm run deploy
(implemented by the Fiori CLI tools).
You can see the full output of the operation at the internal info below from 12/08 11:11:39 by .
Seems that after the deployment the application cannot be located at the ABAP on-premise system.
Please take over to assist the customer.
Thanks,

Hello BC-CP-XF-SRT-BA Colleagues,

could you please take a look as this seems to be a deployment issue with BAS. The customer is waiting for a solution for some weeks now.
I raised the priority to high as this is a important Steampunk customer.

Best Regards
 2021-08-20 07:14:05 -  (D067573) (Internal Info)
Hi colleagues,
it seems there are some problems during the deployment, can you help please.
if you are not the correct component please forward it to the responsible team for deployment . Best regards,  2021-08-19 13:10:21 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Dear , ....

and now you are at the same point like me a few days before! Where ist the app???
Also after redeploying there was no app or the ui5 launchpad app discriptor objects.

If the app or the launchpad app discriptor objects get lost or deleted accidentally, you have to create a complet new app!
But this could be the solution... My expactations is that the missing objects are created automatically when deploying ore redlpoying. Here you can see the protocol from redeploying.

Regards,

Dear Customer,
Unfortunately we can’t see the UI5 application with ID:  /OAY/FB_ANALYSIS_UI5R in the system as Part of IAM apps ,
We can see the following ones
/OAY/AP_PRFL_UI_UI5R
/OAY/DEPARTM_UI_UI5R
/OAY/FEEDBACK_UI_UI5R
Did anything change from your side in the meanwhile ? Since the app doesn’t exist so the business catalog is not selectable. Can you confirm please, so we can check further if something went wrong with the deployment. Sorry for the inconvenience. Best regards, Development Team,  2021-08-17 12:52:37 -  (I303150) (Internal Info)
Hi BC-SRV-APS-IAM  colleagues,

can you please provide some information about the process?
I don't see BC /OAY/FB_ANALYSIS_BC maintained in the system. I checked in content manager /UI2/FLPCM_CUST
I suppose BC shouldn't have records in sui_tm_mm_app  in TSD

Best regards!

yes, we tried to publish localy. But it is still not visible.
Yes, you can change the objects to find a solution.

could you try to do a "Publish locally" on the business catalog /OAY/FB_ANALYSIS_EXT and check if this solves the issue?
If not do you give us your consent to change the objects in the system in order to reproduce the issue?

in the attached files you can see my User (Person ID 2 / CB0000000002 ). The Role APPRENCY_APPRENTICE is assigend to my User and this role contains the catalog /OAY/FB_ANALYSIS_BC.

Please see the files businesscatalog2app, business_catalog & 2021-07-26_11h36_36. Mayby something is wrong?! All objects are published localy.

However, when i try to maintain my lauchpad site i did not see the Business Catalog to assign the app. See file missing_business_catalog.

Dear customer,
Your incident has been routed to the BC-SRV-APS-IAM support team. Could you tell me a little more detail please ?
But the User could not assigne the app to ther launchpad. It means that the catalog contains the tile, but when you try to add tile to Launchpad, it doesn't show up there. It is correct ? Does this problem occur only in specific app ?
For further analysis, we would like to check behavior in your system. Could you provide how to reproduce this issue step by step ? May I reproduce this issue on your system ? Could you tell me tile, catalog and role name please ?
And could you provide CB user please ?

Dear ,

You can try following steps:
(1) Create project Create a new project original-source/origin_poject as list report object page in your SBAS dev space. The project has to use the same service as your project you want to download.

(2) Switch UI5 version to https://ui5.sap.com/resources/sap-ui-core.js in original-source/origin_poject/webapp/index.html. This is required due to an possible old version of UI5 (1.60).

(3) Build original-source/origin_poject using
npm run build

(4) Download your app you want to check using ABAP report /UI5/UI5_REPOSITORY_LOAD into a folder exported, store files one by one.

(5) Restore app into restore-from-exported
copy exported/Component.js exported/index.html exported/manifest.json
from exported into restore-from-exported/webapp

copy
exported/locate-reuse-libs-dbg.js to restore-from-exported/webapp/utils/locate-reuse-libs.js

copy
original-source/origin_poject/.gitignore original-source/origin_poject/package.json original-source/origin_poject/ui5.yaml
into restore-from-exported
(6) run
npm install
in restore-from-exported.

(7) run
npm start
in restore-from-exported.

I hope this helps.

Thank you for your reply. But I'd like to create processflow screen by using our addon table and SAP standard table. So I cannot do this by Adaptation Project. The main purpose is to I understand how to create Process flow and I'd like to create our original processflow by using SAP standard table and Addon table. I'l not modify, just copy and customize for our process flow screen, this is the purpose. Best Regards,  2022-07-15 09:48:27 -  (D040068) (External Info)
Dear customer,

Please be aware of the fact, you shouldn't import built projects into the workspace for further development. Kindly see more detailed information on Import Applications from the SAPUI5 ABAP Repository especially the caution part Don't modify SAP delivered applications. Instead of that, you can use application extension tooling, including extension and adaptation projects.
In case you want to extend an exisitng SAP application, please consider the SAP documentation Extending an SAP Fiori Application. Thank you for your undestanding.

Hi Colleagues,

The customer has imported the source code of a standard app into BAS and is facing issues with data not loading. Can you please confirm if this would fall under BAS or if this should be investigated by the app team?
The customer used the following method.
"
There is no direct way how to check the code for Fiori application in OnPremise. But it's possible to use program /UI5/UI5_REPOSITORY_LOAD on the gateway system and download the repository (https://help.sap.com/saphelp_snc700_ehp04/helpdata/de/a5/60bd6ed4654fd1b338df065d331872/content.htm?no_cache=true). This will be a ZIP file, which can be imported into the WebIDE, where you can see the code then.
Only FYI, the app F2691 „Display Process Flow - Accounts Payable“ is not Fiori Elements app, it is Fiori free-style app."

Hi Team,
Thanks for the input on setting up destination with oAuth2 and client credentials. We would like to know additional setting regarding the same.
Presently we are using client ID and secret to connect to backend OAuth 2.0. Now we are looking for any option to do oAuth authentication using certificate and without client secret. We can see that authentication: ClientCertificateAuthentication is relevant option for certificate , can you please confirm if this is also OAuth enabled.
Does above authentication need private key certificate(.PEM)?if yes, can you please guide us generating private key and public key certificates for sender(SAP BTP) and receiver(Azure) points. Please find the relevant attchment with screnshot details and we would like to have a call and discuss this option as soon as possible, please let us know your avialablity.

Customer had 8-9 apps that needed to be migrated over to a new destination configured with oauth.
Provided the necessary commands and links and customer was happy everything was working even though the API endpoint was offline.
They will continiue to work on their PoC app and will then migrate the existing apps down the line.
This was more of a knowledge sharing call as customer was struggling to understand how to validate their configuration both locally and independently of BAS.

Solution provided: Hi,
Thank you for attending todays sharing session. There were a number of issues addressed;
1. validating both on BAS and on SAB BTP cockpit destination configurations. The necessary curl and dynamic destination links were provided and working as expected. However, the API endpoint is offline and is returning HTML response instead of XML thus we were unable to cpomplete an end to end flow.
2. Migration of apps to the new destination. Using point 1 as a reference, the existing apps would be able to be migrated over to the new destination. This will be validated with a small poc.
3. Cleanup of code in manifest.json and understanding how local preview works.
Closing the ticket, can be reoponed again if any further issues found. 2022-08-30 07:09:30 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)

Escalation justification:  Customer is running AIN and ASPM solutions. They went live 1 month ago approx. They also went live with several Fiori applications built for user for managing some of the assets management processes. Actually these applications are not working, so end users are not able to run their processes as they do 3 days ago.

Hi,
The steps you detailed i.e. call token URL and pass token to API is the expected behaviour of how the SAP BTP destinations work. They encapsulate these steps for you, abstracting away all the security and token passing for you.
So the question is, if you execute these steps via postman, do they work? If the answer is yes, then we need to understand why the SAP BTP destination is not behaving as expected.
There are a couple of reasons why the dynamic destination would return an error 500; 1. you are not subscribed to the  SAP Launchpad Service which is a pre-req for this to work 2. your destination does not have HTML5.DynamicDestination property exposed 3. the service you are calling is not exposed at the endpoint
On point 2, can you provide the destination properties for your sqlodata destination?
On point 3, you are calling the destination as https://nocdev-cepa.launchpad.cfapps.eu20.hana.ondemand.com/dynamic_dest/sqlodata/nocapp.svc/$metadata, however, in the sqlodata destination properties you have defined the URL as https://apidev.noc.qa/oneproc/nocapp.svc/. Destinations work by appending anything after the name of the destination i.e. nocapp.svc/$metadata, your destination is actually making the following call; https://apidev.noc.qa/oneproc/nocapp.svc/nocapp.svc/$metadata so the service is being duplicated. Assuming your destination property URL does not change from https://apidev.noc.qa/oneproc/nocapp.svc/ the correct dynamic link is;
https://nocdev-cepa.launchpad.cfapps.eu20.hana.ondemand.com/dynamic_dest/sqlodata/$metadata
However, when I open https://apidev.noc.qa/oneproc/nocapp.svc/ I get back a 404, is this api endpoint live?
To address your questions;
Our question is can we achieve this via destination setup without making code change in existing Fiori app ? In theory yes, but this will depend on how your existing apps have the xs-app.json and manifest.json datasources defined. If we have to implement OAuth token ,looks like we will loose auto generated code as well as use of SmartFilter Bar and Smart Table? The oauth token exchange should all be encapsulated into a destination
Here is another blog detailing azure integration into SAP BTP destinations; https://startup.lwmeta.com/2021/10/17/sap-btp-integration-with-microsoft-azure-signed-in-user-for-authentication-authorization/
Another sample setup; https://github.com/SAP-samples/btp-azure-opensap/blob/0c0c651103df668b670f474a44ab50d49313d14b/sample-coding/btp-wf-outlook-integration/MSGraphAPI This is missing the destination properties; HTML5.DynamicDestination: true WebIDEEnabled: true

Just for your information, SAP have a consultancy team that can work with you to to better understand your requirements and how to achieve them. I'm suggesting this to you, since you have to understand your existing application configuration to better understand how to configure your new destination so the migration of these destination are seamless. SAP Fiori Tools have limited scope when it comes to advising you on how to manage this migration as its specific to your application and configuration. I'm happy to provide their details if requested.

Hello Team,
we form a below url by following your steps but it's giving the attached error .
https://nocdev-cepa.launchpad.cfapps.eu20.hana.ondemand.com/dynamic_dest/sqlodata/nocapp.svc/$metadata
We have already developed the Fiori apps now we want to implement the OAuth 2.0 Authentication which is a two steps procedure steps 1:- we call the tokel url to fetch the token step  2:- we pass the above token to API url and get/post data
our question is can we achieve this via destination setup without making code change in existing Fiori app ? our current Fiori app uses BAS generated Code and we are also using Smart Filter Bar and Smart Table . if we have to implement OAuth token ,looks like we will loose auto generated code as well as use of SmartFilter Bar and Smart Table because it seems we can not make OData call while consuming data from OAuth Destination. Please let us know if this is correct understanding and please suggest if there is any alternate.
Thank you! 2022-08-29 09:23:56 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
I've just reviewed your issue and here are some steps to help resolve your issue;
My assumptions are the following; 1. You have existing apps deployed and the destination configurations are no longer working
2. You need to validate your datasources independent of Fiori Tools/Elements
3. You have also referenced generating a new Fiori application using the misconfigured destination

Are you able to validate the token service URL and odata calls using postman? If these work where you retrieve an auth token that is appendedto the API call and able to retrieve a valid JSON response then there is no reason why this cant work using SAP BTP destinations.
In order to address assumption 1 & 2 first, please follow these steps;
Pre-req: You are subscribed to the SAP Launchpad Service, follow this tutorial for more information https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/cp-portal-cloud-foundry-getting-started.html You are subscribed to SAP Business Application Studio, follow this tutorial for more information https://help.sap.com/products/SAP%20Business%20Application%20Studio/9d1db9835307451daa8c930fbd9ab264/6331319fd9ea4f0ea5331e21df329539.html
1. In your SAP BTP Cockpit, select your subaccount overview page 2. Note the `Subdomain` attribute i.e. `my-subdomain` 3. Note the `API endpoint` attribute i.e. https://api.cf.eu10.hana.ondemand.com thus the region in this case will be `eu10` 4. Select `Destinations` under `Connectivity` tab on the left navigation bar 5. Filter the destinations using the name of your chosen destination 6. Select your destination i.e. `MyDestination` 7. Select `Edit` 8. Set the following `Additional Properties`, if not already set; HTML5.DynamicDestination: true WebIDEEnabled: true 9. Select `Save`, please ensure you have the client secret if required 10. Generate the link as follows, replacing the four values as follows; https://.launchpad.cfapps..hana.ondemand.com/dynamic_dest/ /
For example: Single OData Service https://my-subdomain.launchpad.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/dynamic_dest/MyDestination/sap/opu/odata/sap/My_Business_Service/$metadata - Replace `/sap/opu/odata/sap/My_Business_Service/` with the specific name and path of your OData Service
OData Catalog V2 https://my-subdomain.launchpad.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/dynamic_dest/MyDestination/sap/opu/odata/IWFND/CATALOGSERVICE;v=2/ServiceCollection
OData Catalog V4 https://my-subdomain.launchpad.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/dynamic_dest/MyDestination/sap/opu/odata4/iwfnd/config/default/iwfnd/catalog/0002/ServiceGroups?$expand=DefaultSystem($expand=Services)
11. Open a new browser tab, to validate the URL is working i.e. assuming its an OData Service, XML/JSON should be returned 2022-08-28 10:04:16 -  (I550810) (Internal Info)
Moved the ticket back to CA-UX-IDE for now; if this is not in your court, please move it to the relevant component supporting the scenario and its configuration. 2022-08-28 08:15:36 -  (I550810) (Internal Info)
Hi colleagues,
As can be seen in the customer's screenshot, the error occurs when reaching out to the destination via BTP Cockpit. This seems to indicate there's likely a misconfiguration issue unrelated to BAS.
Please verify that the customer's configuration is valid according to their scenario.
If the configuration is valid and the issue persists on the BAS authentication infrastructure—let us know.

HI , please see answers on your questions:

- How is this issue affecting customer's business? What is customer unable to do? Customer is running AIN and ASPM solutions. They went live 1 month ago aprox. They also went live with several Fiori applications built for user for managing some of the assets management processes. Actually these applications are not working, so end users are not able to run their porcesses as they do 3 days ago.

- How many users are being affected by this issue?
around 20 users.

- Is there any workaround in place?
For the moment they are trying to run urgent processes skiping the Fiori applications (directly in AIN and ASPM solutions using standard transactions) . But this is slow and non really feasible to maintain during a  time. Also users are losing their trust in the solution.

- Is there any deadline to solve the issue? If yes, when is the deadline?
No specific deadline, but please before users decide not to use the solution or argumenting  it does not work and decide to skip it for their current business process. 

- Is there any consequence for customer in case the deadline is missed? Any fines, financial losses, penalties?
Financial impact might be the would extend their maintenance post go love period with partner, if they are not able to run the solution as it was designed.

Hello ,

Can you please confirm what happens when you select "Check Connection" from the destination in your cockpit?  Does the connection successfully complete?  If it doesn't, I will forward you to the relevant team to investigate.

Also, can you please confirm that the endpoint resolves to an OData service?  The Fiori tools currently only supports OData endpoints and cannot work with rest services.

Hi Customer,

From discussing this with my colleague, I can see that the service you are using is not an OData service, and therefore won't be supported in the SAP Fiori tools.

If you want to use a non-OData service in your Fiori application, please launch the generator and choose "SAPUI5 freestyle" from the "Application Type" dropdown.
Then choose "SAPUI5 Application", and ensure you select "None" as a data source.  This will generate a standard freestyle Fiori application with no data source.

You will then have to manually update the code to add the JSON service.  There are some resources online to help you, please see blog https://blogs.sap.com/2018/06/02/how-to-load-a-json-model-from-manifest-file-and-send-json-object-as-a-parameter-through-routing-and-navigation/ for example.

2022-04-15 11:09:13 -  (I305274) (External Info)
Hello Customer,

Thank you for the information. I am from the Fiori generator team and hopefully can help you.

When providing an OData URL as a data source, the only authentication mechanism supported is Basic Auth.  Can I ask to you confirm that your username and password are correct by doing the following:

In your browser, type in the ODATA service URL that you have been using (https://jobscheduler-rest.cfapps.us10.hana.ondemand.com/scheduler/jobs).  If it's BASIC authentication, you should then be prompted for your username and password in a popup box.

Can you also confirm that the URL you provided is an OData service?  If you append '/$metadata' to the query (i.e. (https://jobscheduler-rest.cfapps.us10.hana.ondemand.com/scheduler/jobs/$metadata) you should be able to see the XML metadata for the OData service.  This will verify that the service can be used in a Fiori application.

Hi , Thank you for providing the update but unfortunately I don't see any new behaviour. The issue is still reproducible even after applying the solution you provided. It is still working like earlier with the earlier workaround you provided "To do so, you need to open the "ui5.yaml" file and comment lines 23-27 (please see the attachment for reference)" but nothing changed with the current update. I still have to comment these lines manually in all projects to stop hanging of editor. I already tried with the existing project mentioned in this OSS and also with creation of a new test project. Also, there is a small typo in your solution. I think you wanted to mention the new version as 1.3.0. Please let me know if you need more information from my side.

Dear Customer,

thank you for your feedback! I was able to reproduce the issue and I am already working on a fix.
Meanwhile as temporary solution I would propose to disable the Auto-Reload of the application.
To do so, you need to open the "ui5.yaml" file and comment lines 23-27 (please see the attachment for reference)

Hello, Before forwarding to my colleague again I had a look at the attached project - if it is huge, complicated, or special w.r.t. any aspect. And yes it is: what I find in the manifest is a mainService of type OData V2, but no description for its pages in a V2 section of type sap.suite.ui.generic.template. Instead, the manifest comprises routing and target definitions as for a V4 service.
This may cause the trouble. Could you please clarify this misalignment between the manifest sections? Best regards,   2021-06-02 09:52:14 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi , I tried with disable Auto Save feature but it still didn't solve the issue. Now the behaviour is, I can write code without problem but as soon I save it (Ctrl+s), the preview starts reloading and editor hangs again. Along with Auto Save, there is another option Auto Save Delay (I also tried changing its value to default 500 ms, 0 ms and 60000 ms), but still the same issue of editor hanging. You could also schedule a call to check the issue together if needed. Please let me know if you need further details. Best regards,  2021-05-31 13:01:39 -  (D062812) (External Info)
Dear customer,
could you please check, if the Auto Save feature of SAP Business Application Studio is enabled? If yes, could you please disable the Auto Save and check if the SAP Business Application Studio still hangs on every change?

Thanks and Best Regards,

Hi colleagues,
the issue is caused by the live reload feature in combination with the auto-save feature. We need to investigate how we can improve the collaboration between the 2 features. Furthermore we've noticed that BAS is freezing when the UI5 resources are loading. I contacted the UI5 colleagues for support.
As a quick workaround the customer can either disable auto-save or the live reload feature. What do you think?
Best Regards,
 2021-05-27 12:44:30 -  (I339272) (Internal Info)
Hi 
is this related to FIORI live reload feature ?
in case it not please assign it to  team

Dear ,
Apologize for the late reply but I was on sick leave. I could not reproduce the issue neither with your project so I have forwarded your ticket to our development team.
I will try to explain them as good as I can but it is possible but they will have some extra questions.

Best regards,  2021-05-26 11:47:42 -  (I327556) (Internal Info)
Dear Colleagues,
The customer has the problem with the UI5 projects that when they run the project and they try to implement any change in the other browser tab in the code editor it has big performance issue since the change is auto synchronized with the tab where the app is running.
There was no performance issue in Web IDE but they have it in BAS. I tried to reproduce it but I could not.
I had already a screen share with the customer who showed me that indeed it takes around 4-5 seconds till the auto complete tool was laoding.

Can you please take a look at it from your side?
Thank you and best regards,

Hi , I have attached the project folder. Please check and feel free to schedule another call to check the issue together. Best regards,  2021-05-13 11:54:43 -  (I327556) (External Info)
Dear ,

I just tested it with a simple project from template, only with an overview page and there was no performance issue while I did any change in the project while it was running in another tab.

Would it be possible to attach your complete project? I will try with that as well. and if not working we can schedule another call.

Hi,
What you have submitted is still not valid! You are making an API request to a third party site where the origin does not match.
Please refer to this site, even though its old, it still explains the root cause;
https://answers.sap.com/questions/11681886/no-%27access-control-allow-origin%27-in-webide.html
This will not work for example when deployed to ABAP or Cloud Foundry target system since these platforms will not allow outbound requests like this. For a Cloud Foundry deployment, you need to route everything through destinations.
If you follow this blog post it will give you more insight to how destinations work and should be managed by your app;

Hi,
Without understanding the structure of your application or how the API call is being invoked, the CORS error relates to Site A making a request to site B which is not supported. Please refer to the following link for more information.
https://portswigger.net/web-security/cors/access-control-allow-origin
If you have custom code written please ensure you are using the proxy middleware to route calls to external sites. Please refer to https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sap/ux-ui5-tooling for more information on this topic.
Here is an example of a ui5.yaml configuration that allows a Fiori UI application to make an API request to a third party site;
https://github.com/SAP-samples/fiori-tools-samples/blob/main/neo-migration/fioriapp/ui5.yaml
If you are running this on VS Code, then remove the destination field as this is only supported on Business Application Studio.
I hope this answers your question.

Hi ,
Thanks for your patience on this. SAP Fiori tools at this point will not be providing out of the box feature to import applications from SAPUI5 ABAP Repository.
You can perform some manual steps to import your application in SAP Business Application Studio workspace. Below I have listed the steps. Please follow them and let me know if you have any additional question.

In your system, create a folder called “exported” (this folder will temporary contain all the downloaded files as you proceed with the instructions) Create another folder and call it as “restore-from-exported” (this folder will contain the restored app) Create one more folder called “original-source” (this folder will contain the temporary generated project) Using SAP Fiori Tools Fiori generator, create a List Report Object Page application using the OData service being using in the deployed application. For the sake of following the instructions, please name the project “zoriginal”. Make sure that the generated project is saved in the folder “original-source” Now, Log into your ABAP system

Goto transaction SE80 Run the report “/UI5/UI5_REPOSITORY_LOAD” Provide the Name of SAPUI5 App and select . From the resulting view,  all the files one by one into the folder “exported” Copy “Component.js”, “index.html”, manifest.json” from folder “exported” to “restore-from-exported/webapp” Copy “original-source/zoriginal/.gitignore”,  “original-source/zoriginal/package.json”, “original-source/zoriginal/ui5.yaml” into “restore-from-exported” At this point, if you are using SAP Business Application Studio or VSCode, please import the folder “restore-from-exported” into your workspace. Now from terminal in folder “restore-from-exported” run “rpm install” Then run “npm start”

Best Regards,

Hi, As I suspect correctly, there is an issue with npm module @sap/ux-ui5-tooling for version above 1.7.5. After installing v1.7.0, I don't see any issue in preview application. There is one more work around for v1.8.0 - Open fiori-tools-proxy.js(file location is in your error msg) file and change line 110445, just return false. I have tested both the work arounds provided in this link and both are working. https://answers.sap.com/questions/13732385/issue-while-executing-npm-start-run-in-vs-code-usi.html Hopefully my finding will help to rectify the ui5 tooling issue.

Hi, 1. It's interesting. When I check node version via command prompt, it's v16. I am not sure why environment check is picking v14. 2.  is generated on windows using Microsoft Visual studio code. Apps previews are working fine with Node module @sap/ux-ui5-tooling v1.5.2. Once we updated SAP Fiori Tools - Extension Pack v1.8.0, It's started giving error in fiori-tools-proxy.js at function isUI5VersionRemoved. When I preview application with ui5-local.yaml, I can see preview but with dummy data. Issue is previewing application with real data from ABAP server. As it was working previously, I don't see issue with connectivity. Let me know if you need more information to investigate. Thansk,  2022-11-01 16:52:38 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
Sorry to hear you are having this connectivity issue.
Can I please confirm a few things?
1. Based on the environment check, you are running node v14 and not v16. Our tooling will work with both.
2. Where was the  generated? On Windows or on Business Application Studio (BAS) ? The reason I ask, the onPremise destination that you are referring to needs to be accessible on windows. Remember, SAP BTP destinations are exposing connection properties which in your instance is dependent on a cloud connector configuration. If you look at the ui5.yaml file, it should contain the destination and the destination URL, since you are not on a BAS dev space, the local preview will try to use the URL. If this URL is not directly availbable from your windows machine then the local app preview will not work.
I have provided a link to understand more around onPrem destinations https://help.sap.com/docs/BTP/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/9b6510edf4d844a28f022b3db41f3202.html and a deeper understanding of configuing a local cloud connector https://blogs.sap.com/2022/07/18/how-to-connect-on-premise-sap-to-btp-using-sap-cloud-connector/.
Please let me know if this provides enough information for you to understand the root cause of your issue?
Thanks.

Hi ,
As promised earlier, I have some update for you. After discussions with our UI5 colleagues, the recommendation is that typescript offers code completion intrinsically, and that JS code completion would require imports of TS types in an unwieldy way.  Therefore the UI5 recommendation is to support code completion with typescript only, and that is our plan going forward.  The open source templates (https://github.com/SAP/open-ux-tools/tree/main/packages) that the Fiori generator consumes now already supports typescript. For now, SAP Fiori Generator will allow you to SAPUI5 application with typescript enabled. To try it out please create a SAPUI5 application and enable Typescript in Advanced Configuration. This will generate a typescript enabled project.
Going forward its in SAP Fiori generator backlog to deliver this functionality to all our templates. We will be publishing the changes in our Release Notes.
Please let me know if you have any questions/concerns around this.

Hi,
Just following up on the Service Centre tool not retrieving the v2 | v4 services, can you please refer to these steps to ensure the catalog services are exposed;
https://github.com/SAPDocuments/Tutorials/blob/62a65ead5012ebcea7b0204a376b7d33e1693ef5/tutorials/abap-environment-vs-code/abap-environment-vs-code.md
Please refer to `Create IAM App and business catalog` which details how to ensure any of the v2 | v4 services are exposed.
Another way to independently verify your destination is configured correctly to expose either a serivce or catalog of services, is to expose the destination as follows;
Open your destination in your SAP BTP Cockpit; 1. Set the following Additional Property HTML5.DynamicDestination: true 2. Note the name of your destination 3. Select the Overview page of your Subaccount 4. Note the subdomain of your subaccount 5. Note the API endpoint region i.e. eu10, where the region is specified as https://api.cf.eu10.hana.ondemand.com 6. Generate a new link as follows https://.launchpad.cfapps..hana.ondemand.com/dynamic_dest/ / 7. Open a new browser to validate the URL is working, there should be an XML response from the backend
Please let me know if this resolves your issue?

Solution provided: Hi ,
with the latest version of our software, we have provided the fix that avoids generating cross-references with the sibling apps. If some element is defined in one app, it can no longer be edited from the other app to prevent the cross-references.
This means, that any new changes you make in your apps should no longer result in the cross referencing and each individual app can be deleted when you don't need it any longer.
The fix does not  remove the existing cross-app references, so you still should do it manually as suggested by  if you have not done this yet. I'm sorry for this inconvenience.

Hi ,
a fix is in the works for avoiding the cross-reference of annotation files between different applications in one project. In the meantime, you can manually delete those stale references after deletion as follows.
From below the "burger" menu on the top left corner, choose the "Explorer" view. There open the "app" folder and open the folder of the "StoresSupplierList" app. There you will find an "annotation.cds" file. Open it, and delete the third line with the stale using statement "using from '../EGStoreAdHocOrderPortalv2.ProductCatalogue/annotations';". Save.
This should resolve the delete issue with the Product Catalog app.
Best regards,

Thanks for the update . I can confirm that there were no manual changes to file. Best Regards,  2022-05-23 11:55:32 -  (D044415) (External Info)
Hi ,
want to give you an update. The immediate cause of the issue is that the deleted applications own "annotation.cds" file is actually used/referenced within the "annotation.cds" file of another application "StoreSupplierList" which leads to the problem after deletion. We are currently investigating how this could happen (it shouldn't), assuming there were no manual changes to the files.

Hello , Many thanks for the instructions. I have attached what I believe to be the requested zip file, I have also attached the screenshots of how I acquired the file in the context of your steps for completeness and your awareness in case something different is required. Best Regards,  2022-05-18 12:52:54 -  (D044415) (External Info)
Dear ,
 asked me to have a look into the delete issue with remaining references. However from the logs it is not fully clear what happens, so I would like to ask you to zip, download and attach your project in the state directly before the delete operation, so we can try ourselves and debug what happens, if this is ok for you.
To do this please:

Click the tree-like button on left-bottom-corner (Project Explorer)

Choose "Template-based, responsive Application"
Find the folder of your project, and click on the litte (i) icon to the right of the line, this opens the Application Info page From there please choose the "Create Archive" option under "What you can do" Now click the three-line button on left-top-corner (Application Menu) -> File -> Open. In the dialog, click the dropdown and select "projects". Select "open", the BAS workspace is refreshing Go to the "Explorer" (the double folder icon on the left bar) if not yet opened, and under "projects" you see a zip file with your project name and a timestamp Right-click on this file and choose "Download" from the context menu
Attach the file here and send the ticket back. You can go back to the original folder the same way as in step 5, 6, but selecting your project folder in the list under "projects", and click "open".
Thanks and best regards,

Hi ,
Very sorry for the inconvenience and thx for the feedback. Good to know the original issue1 didn't block any more.
If you have the time, I'd like to request you to do us a favor to improve the product by uploading 2 log files. Their name should be "lcap.home.2022-05-12.log" and "ProjectApi-2022-05-12.log".
For the 1st log file lcap.home.2022-05-12.log, it can be downloaded by:
Click the three-line button on left-top-corner (Application Menu) -> File -> Open. In the dialog, click the dropdown and select "user". Among the files in user folder, there should be lcap.home.2022-05-12.log, select and open it. Again the three-line button on left-top-corner -> File -> Download, you'll be prompted with downloading this file.
For the 2nd log file ProjectApi-2022-05-12.log, it can be downloaded by a similar way:
Click the three-line button on left-top-corner (Application Menu) -> File -> Open. In the dialog, click the dropdown and select "/" root directory. Among the files under / folder, expand the "tmp" folder. Among files under tmp folder, there should be ProjectApi-2022-05-12.log, select and open it. Again the three-line button on left-top-corner -> File -> Download, you'll be prompted with downloading this file.
It will help us to gather more information about the root cause of 1st issue, the occasionally vanished items.

Hi Colleagues,
Thx for feedback. For the issue2 (deletion of UI can result in broken CDS dependency in annotation), I'd like to request Fiori Elements team to have a look (Application Modeler in Fiori Tools, perhaps)
Hi @ (*SAP-ID*), I'd like to request your ideas. According to description, FE App was deleted through API in app modeler but there're still remaining references to its *.cds file. Would it be a pure code-edit behavior which is out of scope of LCNC? Thx.

Dear Colleague, Could you please help to check on this incident? : Initially, there are 2 issues. i) the disappearing and re-appearing Data Models and Services ii) the Application Development does not seem be able to handle when a User Interface is deleted. Now issue i) has been solved. Only issue ii) exists. Customer found that the Application Development cannot handle when a component (User Interface) has been deleted. For details, please refer to <348700 - Missing data Model and Serv.pdf > : 1. No changes were made before noticed Data Models and Services issue i). The issue was common to 3 different applications and all 3 had the same issue. 2. The same UI type for "ProductCatalogue" is also used when created UI again. 3. No document is used in the set-up of the UI, set-up simply involves following the steps of the LCNC UI wizard (as can be seen in the Step-by-Step guide). As researched with error, "Error while retrieving the list of cds files for project" "Error was" "Cannot convert undefined or null to object"=>couldn't found any case/documentation mentioned for it. Could you please help to check the issue? Best regards,  2022-05-16 08:34:12 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hello , 1. No changes were made. The issue was common to 3 different applications and all 3 had the same issue. 2. Yes, the same UI type for "ProductCatalogue" is used. 3. No document is used in the set-up of the UI, set-up simply involves following the steps of the LCNC UI wizard (as can be seen in the Step-by-Step guide). Please note, the original issue in this ticket seems to have been resolved by. The issues that I am now experiencing are similar to those reported in ticket 293790/2022 i.e. it appears that the Application Development cannot handle when a component has been deleted. Do you wish to proceed with this ticket or do we defer all issues into 293790/2022 ? Regards,  2022-05-14 07:14:24 -  (I513711) (External Info)
Dear , Thanks for your kindly reply with detailed information provided. Regarding this issue, may I know following things as well? 1.Did you make any change before you found "Data Models" and "Services" changed to be visible again? Before you found "Data Models" and "Services" not working, did you make any change? Example: delete UI. 2.You mentioned "ProductCatalogue" has been deleted because you want to create a new one with different Application Type template. May I know when you created new UI and made it working again, did you use same Application Type template, or different one? What are the types of them? 3.If you have refer to any documentation for setup UI, please kindly provide us the link of it. Best regards,  2022-05-14 07:04:47 -  (I513711) (Internal Info)

The configuration seems fine. 2022-06-14 15:35:00 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi, In reference to Seventh Time :: Evidence for Internal System Destination" (Page 50), the issue is with your app controller. If you refer to page 50, the controller code is still showing the following; `url: "/api/v2/products/86669191"` To understand this more: 1. Viewing the app on SBAS When the app is run in local preview mode in SBAS, the generated url is; https://port8080-workspaces-ws-zqbdc.br10.applicationstudio.cloud.sap/test/flpSandbox.html?sap-ui-xx-viewCache=false#lmbrsapbtpmaterialpicture-display The base url is https://port8080-workspaces-ws-zqbdc.br10.applicationstudio.cloud.sap Your ui5.yaml is defined as backend: - path: /api url: https://api-test.leroymerlin.com.br/api/v2 destination: lmbsite So when your controller code is invoked it calls the following api https://port8080-workspaces-ws-zqbdc.br10.applicationstudio.cloud.sap/api/v2/products/86669191 which gets picked up by the fiori-tools-proxy middleware, forwards the request to the lmbsite destination and everything works. 2. Viewing the app on CF First thing to note, the ui5-deploy.yaml has a builder node which defines a number of steps in order for your app to be bundled and  to CF. However, in your case, you have hardcoded the URL in your controller. This builder task does a number of jobs, one task is to cleanup the manifest.json URI datasources. A typical datasource in the manifest.json looks like this "dataSources": { "mainService": { "uri": "/api/", "type": "OData", "settings": { "odataVersion": "4.0" } } }, So, when the mtar is generated for CF deployment, the URI is updated from "uri": "/api/", to "uri": "api/", please note the missing leading forward slash. This is done on the fly, so your existing code remains in tact but the code actually  to CF is updated. The reason for this is as follows; Your Fiori Freestyle mtar archive is  to the following base URL, this is a unique name/version as the expectation is you will have many apps  into your dev space: https://lmbr-backoffice-dev.launchpad.cfapps.br10.hana.ondemand.com/ff99.lmbrsapbtp-materialpicture.lmbrsapbpicture-1.0.0/ In your xs-app.json your route is defined as; { "source": "^/api/(.*)$", "target": "/api/$1", "destination": "lmbsite", "csrfProtection": false, "authenticationType": "none" }, The xs-app.json works the same way as the fiori-tools-proxy middleware, it listens for requests starting with api and forwards them to the specified destination. Now, the issue you are having is down to the following two scenarios; 1. Scenario 1 - controller code is NOT updated thus it remains as `url: "/api/v2/products/86669191"`. Your controller code will now make the following API call https://lmbr-backoffice-dev.launchpad.cfapps.br10.hana.ondemand.com/api/v2/products/86669191 This will NOT work since there is no active route at /api thus you will get a 404. The xs-app.json route wasn't triggered as your API call was made against your subaccount and NOT your  application. The reason for this, you have specified an absolute route in your controller which means it will not pickup the location of your application url i.e. /api 2. Scenario 2, controller code is updated to `url: "api/v2/products/86669191"`, please note the leading forward slash is removed. Your controller code will now make the following API call https://lmbr-backoffice-dev.launchpad.cfapps.br10.hana.ondemand.com/ff99.lmbrsapbtp-materialpicture.lmbrsapbpicture-1.0.0/api/v2/products/86669191 the xs-app.json is invoked since the API was made at application level and NOT subaccount level This works since its using a relative path i.e. / /api Please refer to another question that might help https://answers.sap.com/questions/13323065/sap-business-application-studio-multiple-rest-api.html?childToView=13323777#answer-13323777
Remember, dynamic_dest is a route that is exposed at subaccount level, /dynamic_dest,  it's not tied to any application.
I hope this resolves your issue.  2022-06-14 13:55:33 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi , You are considering a wrong PDF attached. In my last interaction I attached the PDF HAN-CLS-HC = Sap Ticket 188702 _ 2022 - Destination _OAuth2ClientCredentials_ does not work (7).pdf, on topic topic "Seventh Time :: Evidence for Internal System Destination" (Page 50). Inside that, I insert many evidences without "slash" that I are talking about. The error 404 caused by "slash" at end of URL was solved because before. This erros was occurring in BAS and in  App. Right now the API CALL works in BAS but after  this same CALL returns a 404 error. When I open the URL with error in another Tab and insert a "dynamic_dest/lmbsite" it works. Please take a look at PDF above to see the error that I was talking about. Tks.   2022-06-14 08:39:55 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
Yes, the issue with the 404 based on your latest PDF attachment is due to the leading forward slash in URL i.e. "/api/v2/products/86669191/". This needs to be removed as it needs the relative path when  to CF.
If you load your  app on CF, open a network console, you will see that your specific API call is using a different URL to all the other API calls. The reason the /dynamic_dest works, is because that path is using an exposed route on your subaccount. If you look at the your screen shots, your app is using /api which is NOT an exposed route on your subaccount level only at application level.
Each  app to CF is given a unique ID, the manifest name and version to create the link i.e. here is a sample link
https://sap-ux-stage.launchpad.cfapps.sap.hana.ondemand.com/qa-apps.sapuxdemotravel-1.0.0
So in order for your API call to be triggered it needs to be calling the application route;
https://sap-ux-stage.launchpad.cfapps.sap.hana.ondemand.com/qa-apps.sapuxdemotravel-1.0.0/api/v2/products/86669191/
However, in your case its calling a subaccount route
https://sap-ux-stage.launchpad.cfapps.sap.hana.ondemand.com/api/v2/products/86669191/
which does not exist on the sub-domain sap-ux-stage. Again, when you subscribe to the launchpad service it exposes a new route i.e.
https://sap-ux-stage.launchpad.cfapps.sap.hana.ondemand.com/dynamic_dest/lmbsite/api/v2/products/86669191/
which is why this route works.
Just to clarify as well, the reason it works on BAS when doing a local preview is the app route does not have a unique id since its opening up a port against your specific BAS account and is exposing the route as the base. This is NOT the case in CF since it needs a unique indiciator to be able to route the different apps when .
If you log into your SAP BTP Cockpit, select your subaccount, select HTML5 Applications, hover over the links for each of the  apps, you will see the full URL.
If you have made any further modicifations to your app, please attach for review using the command, replacing with the location of your project folder:
zip -r feproject.zip ./ / -x *///*-*PHONE*.* *.git* //*-*PHONE*.* *.zip *.env* *.mta *.rb *.bak *.swp *.DS_Store *.back *.merge *.txt *.sh **/resources///*-*PHONE** **/mta-op-*///*-*PHONE** **/gen///*-*PHONE** **/node_modules///*-*PHONE** **/mta_archives///*-*PHONE** **/dist///*-*PHONE** **/.ABAPDeployResources///*-*PHONE** **/.vscode///*-*PHONE**

Hello, I Have seen this blog but it's a litle bit different that I was Trrying to do. In this Blog the project has a DATASOURCE and MODEL created for fix URL consuming data form SubAccount where the APP was . In my case, I have two destinations according detailed below: Destination one (): Used for get data from Odata Service Exposed on SAP Backend. It works fine. Destination two (lmbsite): Used to consume another internal system to retrieve material pictures URLs, with data will be "concatenated" according material selection in application. I believe that exist some error during ROUTES composite, because the data only can be got using the prefix /dynamic_dest/lmbsite/ un URL to get Data. As I told in last attached document, this errors occurs only AFTER APP deploy. During Local tests inside BAS this erros doesn't happens. Waiting,   2022-06-07 10:53:40 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,

 2022-06-07 09:58:16 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
Your issue is related to how the API is being called. When a  application is bundled for deployment to Cloud Foundry (CF), any URI datasource referenced in the manifest.json is updated to have the leading forward slash removed i.e. from /api/myservice to api/myservice.
Since you have a custom implementation, you need to handle this scenario. In theory, you can remove the forward slash and it should work in both SBAS and on CF.
As shown in your latest document, the absolute URL is being called to retrieve your datasource but this is incorrect as it needs to be relatvie path so that the xs-app.json routing can handle it. If you review your network console, you will see the additional calls being made with which have a different URL to what you have referenced. Removing the leading forward slash in your controller will resolve your issue.
You can write custom code or make this a configuration parameter passed in when the app is  to the resepective environment i.e. SBAS or CF.

Hello, I am sorry by delay to answer, but really this "Slash" cause the error that we are facing before. I changed my app without this "slash" and inside BAS working fine but unfortunately after APP deploy the error 404 is displayed during API consume. Attached the same Evidence, with new topic [ File name : HAN-CLS-HC = Sap Ticket 188702 _ 2022 - Destination _OAuth2ClientCredentials_ does not work (7).pdf ] topic "Seventh Time :: Evidence for Internal System Destination" with evidences and pictures describing the error that we are facing now. I tried to create another APP using  with some Extensions for View/Controller and this same error was displayed. Waiting for Updates,

Dear customer,
we were able to find out what is causing the CORS issue.
API calls that end with a forward slash "/" are triggering a redirect. E.g.
"/api/v2/products/86669191/" will trigger a redirect and will cause a CORS issue. BUT calling e.g.

"/api/v2/products/86669191" will return the correct response with the data.
So please remove any forwards slashes at the end in the API Requests of your application.

Furthermore calling either "/api/v2/" or "/api/v2" triggers always a redirect. Could you please check with the owner of the API about this strange behaviour and also about the difference in the behaviour with and without a "/"?

Hope this helps!

Best regards,

The Fiori tools team

HI,

Waiting for any news about that. Tks.   2022-05-06 13:28:37 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Thank you for the update.
There is a high internal ticket now created and will be investigaged by the team.
 2022-05-06 13:00:36 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi , About your question, our internal API is used for many another systems, calling the same API, and this erros do not occurs unless SAP BTP. Change this API is a remote possibility, considering that all another systems can call this API without errors. I made a little introduction with API Owner and this solutions is not an easy way, because it enable some vulnerabilities in out API host (there many another API already and this behavior is mandatory). For CORS error, I believe that the only parameter 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' will be solve this error, but it must be handled in "ui5 middleware", or after solve it another mandatory parameters will be asked. Considering that You can call directly our API, you can evolve this solutions until get a success on API CALL and mapping all Header Parameters necessary to enable this kind of call. As I wrote on WhatsApp, unfortunately I don't have any additional information beyond that I sent before. Tks.   2022-05-06 10:48:23 -  (I313149) (Internal Info)
Internal GH created https://github.wdf.sap.corp/ux-engineering/tools-suite/issues/19657 2022-05-05 22:05:27 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
I've managed to get your destination working on a staging environment we have internally and Im seeing the same issue, a 301 direct. The middleware proxy must be missing a header which is causing this redirect.
You had mentioned in a previous post, an API owner, would it be possible to reach out to them again to confirm what headers are required to prevent the 301 redirect?
Currently, the curl command and the dynamic destination flow work fine but when calling ui5-tooling middleware proxy causes a 301 redirect which is then forcing the browser to change the location to https://homolog.leroymerlin.com.br which then causes the cors error.
It would be great to confirm the required reqest headers as there could be a gap in our middleware as its the first time we are seeing this issue.
Thanks.

Hi, I made the same changes inside our project (manifest and xs-app.json), but the API call continue not working, giving an error about CORS like detailed before. I have attached project ZIP with all content of our project. When this APP was executed in PREVIEW APPLICATION, during page inspect, the CORS error was displayed (05May-material_picture.zip) after onINIT method. To enable you to do the same calls and you can see the error in your PROJECT, there is a zip file called "lmbsite.zip" with destination for our API. Please create a DESTINATION in your SubAccount, I will share in your WhatsAPP the Secret of this destination, enabling you to call our API and see the error during your project execution. In this way, you will see the error during execution. I believe that your JSON API used nowadays doesn't have this feature to disable redirections CALL and CORS errors. Tks.   2022-05-03 13:39:13 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
Yes, the controller is identical as there was no change here. The change was in the manifest.json and in the xs-app.json, please see changes;
manifest.json Changed from: "dataSources": { "mainService": { "uri": "lmbsite/api/v2/", "type": "JSON" } } to "dataSources": { "mainService": { "uri": "/api/v2/", "type": "JSON" } }
xs-app.json
The following route was added as the last { "source": "^(.*)$", "target": "$1", "service": "html5-apps-repo-rt", "authenticationType": "xsuaa" }
The first route listed is { "source": "^/api/(.*)$", "target": "/api/$1", "destination": "lmbsite", "csrfProtection": false, "authenticationType": "none" },
I've re-attached the sample project material_picture-may0322.zip along with the curl command so you can see the headers used. Like I stated previously, the endpoint is a JSON endpoint using a destination created in my subaccount;
curl 'https://port8080-workspaces-ws-2jd8n.us10.trial.applicationstudio.cloud.sap/api/categories' //*-*PHONE* -H 'authority: port8080-workspaces-ws-2jd8n.us10.trial.applicationstudio.cloud.sap' //*-*PHONE* -H 'accept: application/json, text/javascript, */*; q=0.01' //*-*PHONE* -H 'accept-language: en-US,en;q=0.9' //*-*PHONE* -H 'cookie: BASSESSION="4aa8ae733597ec4c"; workspaces-ws-rgtfc_WSR_SESSIONID=K8j/y2pPMlQ9wllincAcXcHIYxFZ8z7QC3mlfZYCNzoZpli0b3VmJSO2Wz1iv2dqXyTW7gKhnjvyTeOc5jq9Gw==; workspaces-ws-2jd8n_WSR_SESSIONID=D0vnPGW9qSjHFL6bsYj/K4m0EnvHGLnXbBRp8ZLW1RPPpbnyOBKGIItcFa5jyvAK0+IhYPEhjQBoqP1BP6gYvw==' //*-*PHONE* -H 'dnt: 1' //*-*PHONE* -H 'if-none-match: W/"313-+du6EUFt8AlXYVolBBByVve40AQ"' //*-*PHONE* -H 'referer: https://port8080-workspaces-ws-2jd8n.us10.trial.applicationstudio.cloud.sap/test/flpSandbox.html?sap-ui-xx-viewCache=false' //*-*PHONE* -H 'sec-ch-ua: " Not A;Brand";v="99", "Chromium";v="100", "Google Chrome";v="100"' //*-*PHONE* -H 'sec-ch-ua-mobile: ?0' //*-*PHONE* -H 'sec-ch-ua-platform: "macOS"' //*-*PHONE* -H 'sec-fetch-dest: empty' //*-*PHONE* -H 'sec-fetch-mode: cors' //*-*PHONE* -H 'sec-fetch-site: same-origin' //*-*PHONE* -H 'sec-gpc: 1' //*-*PHONE* -H 'user-agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/100.0.4896.127 Safari/537.36' //*-*PHONE* -H 'x-requested-with: XMLHttpRequest' //*-*PHONE* --compressed
Please note, this is not doing a redirect. When you do a local preview, the ui5.yaml is read and the properties of the backend are used to determine if the api is called i.e. https://port8080-workspaces-ws-2jd8n.us10.trial.applicationstudio.cloud.sap/api/v2/, if it detects this route then it delegates it to the destination using the BAS/H20 proxy. The destination lmbsite should then take care of any auth tokens, headers etc that need to be used to inturn to call the exposed backend. This is how it works when  to Cloud Foundry as well. Based on your pervious notes (HAN-CLS-HC = Sap Ticket 188702 _ 2022 - Destination _OAuth2ClientCredentials_ does not work (6).pdf) you are able to call the lmbsite destination using the curl command thus there are no additional headers etc to be added when calling from BAS via the H20 proxy. The middleware is doing the exact same thing, it delegates the request to the destination to make the final call.
BAS -> Local Preview (middleware) -> detects /api/v2/ -> calls $H2O_URL/destinations/lmbsite/api/v2/products/xyz
Please let me know if this makes sense?
Please refer to this link as well https://help.sap.com/docs/CP_CONNECTIVITY/b865ed651e414196b39f8922db2122c7/e4f1d97cbb571014a247d10f9f9a685d.html

Hi, About your example for option 1, I believe that You attached the same zip that I have attached before, because the files View1.controller.js or manifest.json in both projects are identical, without any changes (attached screenshot). About Option1 and Option 2, I believe that works for you because your API enable to call from another caller, with Header Parameters 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' in the request resource, like screenshots that I have sent before. I can't confirm it because I can'tt see Header Parameters of your screenshots in netWork tab. Our Internal API not return this parameters, and because of that this erros occurs. I talk with Owner of Internal API and He told me that he can enable for this API to be called through redirections like is executed now, but It will be a Work Around because he agrees that this redirections during API call would me solved by Application Side. I believe that your API has this parameters/feature configured and make the scenario a little bit different that we are running here. I attached our destination "lmbsite" (for Test environment) enabling you to call our internal API. Please send message (WhatsApp Preferencially) to share Secret and enable you to call our destination. Tks.   2022-04-29 14:11:09 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
I've attached opt1 and opt2 projects along with screen shots showing the working API.
You had incorrectly configured in the controller in opt1, please unzip the files and do a file diff to see the exact changes.
In both apps, I changed the destination to a JSON api exposed by a BTP destination, you can see the calls in the attached screen shots.
The screen shots for opt1 show two network calls since one is being made by the manifest.json datasource and the second by the init function in the controller. Please refer to the URL shown for the request, this is using the BAS enviroment which means its the middleware that is handling the call i.e. directing the API call to the BTP destination.
There were no changes required in opt2 in order for me to get the local preview working.
 2022-04-28 17:20:10 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi, Follow attached Zip for options 1 / 2. Zip FIle: material_picture.zip material_picture_opt2.zip In both projects the API was called in onInit method, where there is a break-point to debug  App during execution. Tks.   2022-04-28 14:29:03 -  (I313149) (External Info)

Hi,Can you please attach the project you have modifying and I will take a closer look.
zip -r feproject.zip ./ / -x *///*-*PHONE*.* *.git* //*-*PHONE*.* *.zip *.env* *.mta *.rb *.bak *.swp *.DS_Store *.back *.merge *.txt *.sh **/resources///*-*PHONE** **/gen///*-*PHONE** **/node_modules///*-*PHONE** **/mta_archives///*-*PHONE** **/dist///*-*PHONE** **/.ABAPDeployResources///*-*PHONE** **/.vscode///*-*PHONE**
Replace ./ / with the name/path of your project. This will generate a zip file, please attach it to the support ticket.
The reason I ask for this zip, based on your attachment, the API is making a direct call to the endpoint which is why you are getting csrf token issues. All calls need to be routed through the middleware which in turn delegates this to the destination.

Hi, Follow information asked in attached document in  "Sixth Time :: Evidence for Internal System Destination" topic Docto: HAN-CLS-HC = Sap Ticket 188702 _ 2022 - Destination _OAuth2ClientCredentials_ does not work (6).pdf Tks.   2022-04-27 13:56:26 -  (I313149) (External Info)
Hi,
At this junction, you need to independently validate your destination for https://api-test.leroymerlin.com.br/ is working correctly;
Can you please confirm if the curl command is working, this assumes the destination lmbsite is exposing the URL as https://api-test.leroymerlin.com.br/;
curl "$H2O_URL/destinations/lmbsite/api/v2/products/86669191" -vs > curl-datasrv-output.txt 2>&1
- please ensure the name and service path are correct, update the command if required
To independently validate your SAP BTP destination configuration of BAS/Cloud Foundry, follow these steps;
Note: Please ensure you have subscribed to the Launchpad Service before proceeding (https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/cp-portal-cloud-foundry-getting-started.html)
1. In your SAP BTP Cockpit, select your subaccount overview page 2. Note the `Subdomain` attribute i.e. `my-subdomain` 3. Note the `API endpoint` attribute i.e. https://api.cf.eu10.hana.ondemand.com thus the region in this case will be `eu10` 4. Select `Destinations` under `Connectivity` tab on the left navigation bar 5. Filter the destinations using the name of your chosen destination 6. Select your destination i.e. `MyDestination` 7. Select `Edit` 8. Set the following `Additional Properties`, if not already set; HTML5.DynamicDestination: true WebIDEEnabled: true 9. Select `Save`, please ensure you have the client secret if required 10. Generate the link as follows, replacing the four values as follows; https://.launchpad.cfapps..hana.ondemand.com/dynamic_dest/ /
For example; https://my-subdomain.launchpad.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/dynamic_dest/MyDestination/sap/opu/odata/sap/My_Business_Service/$metadata
11. Open a new browser tab, to validate the URL is working 12. Please attach any screen shots were applicable
Once the destination is working correctly in curl and via the dynamic destination flow, then we can address some of the issues with your local preview.
1. xs-app.json you have appended the new route lmbsite as last in the list, please ensure this is the first so its the first route dedicated. These routes work similiar to Apache routing where it applis regex to the URL to detect the pattern, if a match is found, it  the API call
Please refer to https://github.com/SAP-samples/fiori-tools-samples/blob/main/cap/cap-fiori-mta/app/feproject-ui/xs-app.json which shows the correct ordering of the routes, where the bottom one is a catchall route or option 1 project attached.
2. manifest.json You have dataSources added in your manifest.json which means you dont need the init controller changes as the Fiori framework will make the calls to retrieve the data. Please refer to option 1 of the sample projects provided.
I provided two sample projects but each is different in how it makes API calls thus require different configuration changes. The two attached projects, option 1 and 2 are very different in how they work.
3. ui5.yaml When running the application in local preview mode, the ui5.yaml acts as a middleware proxy to direct the API calls to the appropiate endpoints. In your case, based on page 38 - 40 you have incorrectly modified the ui5.yaml. The ui5.yaml should be
backend: - path: /api url: https://api-test.leroymerlin.com.br/ destination: lmbsite
Again, this assumes the destination lmbsite in SAP BTP has a URL of https://api-test.leroymerlin.com.br/. The ui5-local.yaml looks to have been modified correctly. Thus when your app is loaded it will make the call..applicationstudio.cloud.sap/. This also explains why you are getting a csrf since if you look at the request URLs they are different. The error exits since you are calling the endpoint directly which wont having the appropiate headers in place as its not making the call through the destination.
At this stage, we need to ensure the destination lmbsite is working expected using either the curl or dynamic destination setup.
If you are still blocked, we can organise another call.

Hello,

I made all changes purposed but when I call the API inside "onInit" controller method, an erros about CORS was displayed. I tried to solve it after some searchs on SAP HELP, but the error was displayed yet. Attached evidences about this interaction, inside "Fifth Time :: Evidence for Internal System Destination".

Generate Freestyle app with JSON using managed approuter
Create a Freestyle UI5 application https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_FIORI_tools/17d50220bcd848aa854c9c182d65b699/616b1a4bd4314070a9fa5bf79ecb3909.html Select SAPUI5 freestyle application type Select SAPUI5 Application Select None as the datasource Input the module and namespace details as per your requirement Select Yes to Add deployment configuration Select Cloud Foundry as the target syste Select your JSON destination Select Yes to Add application to managed application router?
Your new Freestyle application will be generated, however, modifications are required to ensure it works with a JSON API endpoint
Option1. Use existing boiler plate setup
1. Open the manifest.json and edit/add the mainSource as follows;
"dataSources": {
"mainService": {
"uri": "/api/categories",
"type": "JSON"
}
}
2. Ensure the uri is updated to represent the service path i.e. https://northwind.vercel.app/api/categories
3. Remove the metadata.xm file from the localService folder
4. Open xs-app.json and edit/add the following route as the first route in the list, from the top
{
"source": "^/api/(.*)$",
"target": "/api/$1",
"destination": "northwindjson",
"authenticationType": "none",
"csrfProtection": false
},
5. The source and target should represent the starting point of your API endpoint i.e. api, the regex pulls out the first regex group /api/(.*)$ i.e. categories and calls the target and destination with this value i.e. northwindjson/api/cataegories. This will be done for every call that starts with api.
6. To support local preview, open ui5.yaml and ensure the following backend exists;
backend:
- path: /api
url: https://northwind.vercel.app/
destination: northwindjson
7. Replace the path/url and destination with attributes that suit your needs
8. Remove any existing backends if not applicable
9. Make the same changes to ui5-local.yaml if you want to run your app using mock scripts
10. Run npm run start, a new browser tab should be opened, open your network console and/or console tab to see the JSON response from your API call
Option2. Use the init function in your controller
1. Open the manifest.json and remove dataSources
2. Open xs-app.json and edit/add the following route as the first route in the list, from the top
{
"source": "^/api/(.*)$",
"target": "/api/$1",
"destination": "northwindjson",
"authenticationType": "none",
"csrfProtection": false
},
3. The source and target should represent the starting point of your API endpoint i.e. api, the regex pulls out the first regex group /api/(.*)$ i.e. categories and calls the target and destination with this value i.e. northwindjson/api/cataegories. This will be done for every call that starts with api.
4. To support local preview, open ui5.yaml and ensure the following backend exists;
backend:
- path: /api
url: https://northwind.vercel.app/
destination: northwindjson
5. Open View1.controller.js in your controller folder, the name might be different for your project
6. Inside the init function, add the following code
$.ajax({
type: "GET",
url: "/api/categories",
success: function (data) {
console.log(data);
},
error: function (data, textStatus, errorThrown) {
console.log(data, textStatus);
}
});
7. Run npm run start, a new browser tab should be opened, open your network console and/or console tab to see the JSON response from your API call

Hi,
I have attached two projects using two different methods to consume your JSON API endpoint;
Please unzip each zip, run npm install and then npm run start.
I will attach steps to generate your own Fiori Freestyle application using a JSON API endpoint.
Any questions, please let me know.

Hi,
Thank you for attending todays call, it was good to understand your requirements.
Based on today's conversation, you are consuming a destination exposing a JSON API endpoint.  and specifically our Fiori Tools depend on a valid OData XML schema in order to generate Fiori applications.
To allow you to progress with development, you will need to generate a Fiori Freestyle application using custom code in order to consume a JSON API. I will generate a zip and attach it to the ticket on the next working day.
If you have any further questions, please feel free to ask.

Hi, I inserted information on last attaced document and s valid to highlight that this API that i am trying to consume IS NOT a Odata Service. Is a simple API to return data in Json Format, but the Auth Method is OAuth2 like Hana Cloud Destination that we have fixed. THe Wizard will works withou Odata Service ? There are another way to create App with Wizard to consume this API ?

Dear customer,

Sorry to hear you are having problems in using this destination in the Fiori generator.   I think the best thing at this stage is to setup a call with you and have some developers debug this.  Is that ok with you?  If so, please provide a contact email address that we can use to set up a meeting.  Also, please confirm the timezone that you are in so that we can best arrange the meeting.

Thanks,

Hi colleagues,
The customer is trying to create a Fiori application in BAS and connect to a destination in Cockpit.
After resolving his connectivity issues, the customer is able to reach his backend from BAS using a 'curl' command in BAS's terminal. you can see the response in the attached file: HAN-CLS-HC = Sap Ticket 188702 _ 2022 - Destination _OAuth2ClientCredentials_ does not work (4).pdf (page 33).
However, when he is trying to connect to the destination with the template wizard he gets an error. (see the file I mentioned above on page 35).
Can you please validate that the destination returns a valid response body that is acceptable by the template wizard?

Currently I understand the issue left is with destination lmbsite.
From checking the BAS server logs and the screenshot attached, I see the destination is not configured well and it's missing mandatory property HTML5.DynamicDestination=true
Please add this property to the destination and try again
to refresh the destinations data from with in your devspace please run the following command
curl http://127.0.0.1:8887/reload
If you still have any issue after that , please provide the details as you did before

I've checked with destination service team, they told me that there might be a bug in the UI that it shows "Dedicated" while in the database is still "Common". They recommend to click "Edit" then change to Common, then back to "Dedicated" and click "Save".
Can you try this?.
In addition you can check if the destination configuration is correct by calling the destination service API.
See destination service API documentation:
https://help.sap.com/viewer/cca91383641e40ffbe03bdc78f00f681/Cloud/en-US/23ccafbea18f4b65919a2799f2cd20e6.html

Hi , How are you? You are the #3 person that i sent information about this issue. I really waiting for at this time, this error can be solved. This property that you are talking about was set with "Dedicated" like picture attached since ticket was created on Sap Support. I don't know where you get this information about my destination was configured with "Common", but as I told before, this information is wrong. This property has always been set to "Dedicated".

I will repeat the information that I sent 17/March/2022, underlined below:

To be more assertive, we can make a call to reproduce this error together, because this error has being a problem for us, because many internal initiatives was stoped until we can consume external API / ODATA services from another systes ( Using the destination to management bearer tokens). If above alternative is valid for you, please send me a WhatApp message (*PHONE*) to open a GoogleMeeting room and enable us to talk about it. How I don't make any changes and the information was the same that I sent before, I only attached destination ScreenShot to detail the "Dedicated" property on "Token Service URL Type" Is important to highlight that we must to consume API / OData Services from Hana Cloud DB and anothers internal systems that use OAuth Token too, and this type of "DESTINATION" must works for that.

Hi  ,

According to the logs from BAS the approuter error is:
#2.0#2022 03 31 14:12:34:856#+00:00#ERROR#/Handler#####50db8966-bf8d-48f8-9434-bc17227d7841##########50db8966-bf8d-48f8-9434-bc17227d7841#PLAIN##GET request to /destinations/btphanadb/LMB_CONSUME/oData/NoteEmissionTime.xsodata/ completed with status 500 Retrieval of OAuthToken failed due to: You must send the X-tenant header when the tokenServiceURLType property is Common#
However I did not see this in the attachments it looks like the destination configuration has  tokenServiceURLType = Common. Note that approuter does not support sending X-tenant header to destination service.
Can you confirm that you really need to use tokenServiceURLType = Common?
If this is not the case, please change it to "Dedicated" and try again.

Hi , What you are asking is exactly what I did in last  "Customer Action" at 17/March/2022. Why this information generated can not be used for it? Why 15 days after I sent this information SAP Support was asking the same information? This error is a big trouble for us to promote BTP Apps (with  or any another Internal Systems with this Auth Method) in our internal applications, and unfortunately it can create space to another platforms to attendance business gaps. I do not t agree with it but anyway I will send again the same information with error reproduced (as I sent before) and I really hope that at this time, this trouble can be solved as soon as possible. I can not do it right now. I will send this information in the next 2 hours. Waiting for the solution.   2022-03-30 11:27:01 -  (I561992) (Internal Info)

Hi colleagues,
This customer has an OAuth2ClientCredentials destination in Cloud Foundry to an Internet system, so no SCC here.
This destination is correctly configured with all needed properties according to my analysis. When they try to use  with the same properties, they are able to get results from their service endpoint.
However, when they try using curl in BAS or using this destination in the template wizard, they are getting a 500 Internal Server Error.

Your interaction with SAP Support Contact name:  Channel: Chat Interaction summary: Requester name :   Request : Chat received To speed up the incident Business impact :
1. With this mistake we can`t use HANA CLOUD DB and any internal System that use this Auth Method. We can control this token generated internal in each APP, but it will create for us a big rework, mainly now when we are migrating all APPs, and it is not a alternative for us right now.
2. We are starting to use BTP and migrating all APPs to this platform. This mistake is a trouble to our 11k users enabled to use this APPs, when we migrate them.
3. We don`t have a milestones. This mistake disable us to deploy and use each App migrate and it make an underuse Cloud  (Mainly) and their features.
4. Now. Each Day without this connection disable us to use this APP on Production environment.
5. Yes. It is a ShowStopper because without that, we can migrate / create another Apps.

Hi,
Sorry you are experiencing this issue. I will try to help but this is an issue with your ABAP backend. This error indicates that the server has tried to open a transport selection dialog, which won’t work if called via HTTP like in this case. A possible reason would be that the given application namespace does not match the namespace of the selected package.
Can you confirm the namespace and transport requests are valid and correct?

Hi Team, 1. Please check attached destination "EHS_WEBIDE_DS1CLNT200" which we configured in BTP cockpit. Developers are using the same for connection to backend S/4 HANA system. As you can see, Destination is using Basic authentication only with DS1_BTP user (System User). 2. Since DS1_BTP user is system, No email ID is configured and it is not necessary as per my opinion. We can see connections with DS1_BTP user both in STAD and ST05 trace files which means connection is reaching to S/4 HANA system successfully. We just need to find out what dynpro popup is getting displayed in S/4 HANA. As mentioned earlier, we have deployed CHARM tool with ATC checks in S/4 HANA system 3. Attaching screenshots of destination in BTP cockpit and Cloud connector config. We are using basic authentication only. 4. Principle configuration is not getting used anywhere. in S/4 HANA system, SAMl2 is configured. Do we need to add any parameter at WebIDE destination to skip saml2? 5. Yes destination works.

Hi colleagues,
Upon trying to deploy to their ABAP Repository in BAS, this customer is getting the following error:
"A dynpro popup has been opened during processing"
This started happening after implementing Solman and CHARM. Before, it worked fine.
I could not find previous Cases or documentation about this error message. Could you assist with this?

Previously  solman was not implemented so we use to deploy custom sapui5 application  changes through BAS to ABAP repository directly in TR successfully. Now Solman has been implemented and the TR is created through CHARM. Now when we try to deploy the changes then we are getting the error "A dynpro popup has been opened during processing" . We are attaching cloud connector SCC logs for your reference. We are into the middle of our UAT and this issue is blocking 4 critical bugs which will potentially delay the UAT timelines .

******************************



Product Area selected: SAP S/4HANA  > Service Component selected (Manual Selection): BC-XS-CDX --- Description --- Hi, We have developed one CAP application, In which we are using s4 Hana Service as a Value Help for creating records in our application. The service which we are using is “WorkCenterVH”, So In this service there is a 1:N relationship between Work Location(Work Center) and Work Location Plant(Plant) i.e 1 Work center can have multiple plants. So In our Maintenance Request application, we have 2 fields. Work Location Work Location Plant Value help is implemented on Work Location field and on the selection of the work Location, the corresponding plant value should get auto-populated in the plant field which should be a display only/read only field. //Work Center Value help annotate mrorequestdolphinService.MaintenanceRequests with { locationWC @(Common : {ValueList : {   : 'WorkCenterVH', locationWC}', SearchSupported : true, Parameters      : [ { $Type : 'Common.ValueListParameterInOut', LocalDataProperty : 'locationWC', ValueListProperty : 'WorkCenter' }, { $Type             : 'Common.ValueListParameterOut', LocalDataProperty : 'locationWCDetail', ValueListProperty : '' }, { $Type             : 'Common.ValueListParameterDisplayOnly', ValueListProperty : 'WorkCenterCategoryCode' }, { $Type : 'Common.ValueListParameterOut', LocalDataProperty : 'MaintenancePlanningPlant', ValueListProperty : 'Plant' } ] }}); }; There are currently 2 issues: 1. Issue 1 - When creating a Maintenance Request, we need to select a Work Location Value from the Value help. When we select the 1st row (as shown in screenshot 1) i.e. Work Location = AF and Plant = X001 and create a record, the record is saved correctly (as shown in screenshot 2). Now when we Edit the same Maintenance Request and open the Work Location Value Help, and this time select the 2nd row (as shown in screenshot 3) i.e. Work Location = AF and Plant = X003, the new select value of plant is not reflected. It still shows the old plant value i.e. X001. (as shown in screenshot 4) Is there anything missing in the above value help annotation written for the work center? If not how can we resolve this issue? 2. Issue 2 – Since the Work Location Plant field is supposed to be a read only field, if we apply the @readonly annotation to the Work Location Plant field in the entity level, then the field itself is not visible in the UI after creating a maintenance request. Is there any other annotation via which we can make a field as a display only field in the UI. Regards,

Hi , we have tried to change the application version on BAS by creating the new run configuration, but it is not not showing the latest version.. So, we have checked that through the index.html file in app folder we can change the ux version of application on BAS and also it is reflecting the changed version in the application. In the index.html file by writing the statement in the script- src="https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/1.108/resources/sap-ui-core.js". So, Could you just confirm that Is this the correct way of changing the UX version on the BAS? Regards,  2022-12-09 14:21:51 -  (D039850) (External Info)
,
please create a new run configuration, that should help.

Hi , After updating the application version to 1.108, the value helps are working correctly in launchpad. But how we can change the application version on BAS in CAP, means when I'm doing the testing locally by running command "cds watch". Those VH's are not working and also locally the version is showing as 1.98. Also I have updated the ui version in manifest file but it is not getting reflected. Could you tell us how we can change the local version in BAS. Regards,  2022-11-21 15:03:28 -  (D039850) (External Info)

the value help does not work at all in your application.
As your application is on 1.98, you are not able to get update for this version.
We recommend an update to 1.108 if somehow possible.

Hi , Could you help me in Issue 1 (When we refresh the UI screen, we face the same Value Help issue i.e., the selected Work Location Plant is not reflected, only the Old Plant value is visible).

this is usually done via defining the association.
e.g.
entity Books {
key ID : Integer;
title  : String;
author: Integer;
_toAuthor : Association to Authors
on _toAuthor.ID = author

}

entity Authors {
key ID : Integer;
name   : String;
}

annotate Books with @title : ‘List of Books’ {
author @(
Common: {
Text: _toAuthor.name,
TextArrangement: #TextOnly
}
);
}

Hi , Could you tell me how to fill locationWCDetail, As I'm using this field as a Display only field. And also I don't want to use custom logic to fill this field. It should get auto filled after selecting the Work Center. And also for Issue 1, I have tried that after refreshing it second time, but it is not working. If you want we can schedule a call to discuss this issue in deep. Regards,  2022-10-13 14:46:23 -  (D039850) (External Info)
,
please change the dataset so that locationWCDetail property is filled, this may also solve the other issue.
Thanks  2022-10-12 15:29:13 -  (D039850) (External Info)
,
Issue 2 – When we have applied the text annotation on “WorkCenter” field i.e. “locationWC” in main entity i.e. “MaintenanceRequests”, then the text arrangement with ” locationWCDetail“ is not coming.
-> The locationWC is taken because the property locationWCDetail is null, not filled. Please ensure, that this property is filled, then it will be displayed.
Issue 1 – When we refresh the UI screen, we face the same Value Help issue i.e., the selected Work Location Plant is not reflected, only the Old Plant value is visible.
->after refreshing the application, this happens only first time, when opening second time the value help it works. We need to do further analysis here.

Hi , Please check it again, application is working fine now. Thanks,  2022-10-05 12:35:38 -  (D039850) (External Info)

we did further analysis why the field MaintenancePlanningPlant is not updated.
Currently the application is broken, the value helps do not work (Gateway Timeout).
Please tell us, as soon as the application is running properly again.
Thanks 
2022-10-05 12:32:32 -  (D039850) (Internal Info)
We need to investigate in Field.js->_updateCondition(vValue, vAdditionalValue)  why the values are 'lost'
affected field to be updated is:
{

ValueListProperty : 'Plant'

Hi , Sorry for late reply. I have applied the proposed solution given by you. and you can access it through the belowe mentioned link. https://-cf-mreq-dev-mreq-hcl-mro-requestdolphin-ui.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/mro-requestdolphin-ui/webapp/#Shell-home Two issues that are coming while applying the proposed solution-
Issue 1 – When we refresh the UI screen, we face the same Value Help issue i.e., the selected Work Location Plant is not reflected, only the Old Plant value is visible.

Issue 2 – When we have applied the text annotation on “WorkCenter” field i.e. “locationWC” in main entity i.e. “MaintenanceRequests”, then the text arrangement with ” locationWCDetail“ is not coming. Regards,  2022-09-21 12:37:53 -  (D039850) (External Info)
,
please let us know, when the adapted version is available for us to access and for analysing.
Thanks  2022-09-21 09:43:54 -  (D039850) (External Info)
,

thanks for your feedback. May you please provide us the version of this app with our solution proposal so we can analyse the mentioned unwanted results.
Thanks  2022-09-20 06:58:17 -  (*S-USER*) (External Info from Customer)
Hi ,

We have applied the proposed solution by making the “locationWCDetail” field as a display only parameter field in Work Location Value Help instead of making it as out parameter field.
After doing that we are able to select the correct Work Location Plant corresponding to the same Work Location.

But now two new issues are coming –
Issue 1 – When we refresh the UI screen, we face the same Value Help issue i.e., the selected Work Location Plant is not reflected, only the Old Plant value is visible.

Issue 2 – When we have applied the text annotation on “WorkCenter” field i.e. “locationWC” in main entity i.e. “MaintenanceRequests”, then the text arrangement with ” locationWCDetail“ is not coming.
The text annotation we have applied for locationWC is –
annotate mrorequestdolphinService.MaintenanceRequests with {
locationWC @(Common : {Text : {
$value                 : locationWCDetail, ![@UI.TextArrangement] : #TextFirst
}});
}; Thanks,  2022-09-19 12:25:13 -  (D039850) (External Info)
,

sorry for my last maybe misleading proposal.
Please add the text annotation to the Property: 'WorkCenter' at the corresponding main entity.

Best Regards

Hi , The proposed solution is not working correctly like when I refresh the UI screen and the I'm changing the Work location at that time plant is not getting changed and also the text annotation is also not working. Code snippet for text annotation- entity WorkCenterVH             as projection on alpha.WorkCenterVH { WorkCenter             @(            Common.Label : '{i18n>WorkCenter}', /Common       : {  Text            : , TextArrangement : #TextFirst   } )  }; Thanks,  2022-09-15 15:11:15 -  (D039850) (External Info)
,
may you please try out the proposed solution and give us feedback.
Thanks  2022-09-15 12:42:10 -  (D039850) (External Info)
,
These changes will solve this issue:
{ValueList : {   : 'WorkCenterVH', locationWC}', SearchSupported : true, Parameters      : [ { $Type             : 'Common.ValueListParameterInOut', LocalDataProperty : 'locationWC', ValueListProperty : 'WorkCenter' }, { $Type             : 'Common.ValueListParameterDisplayOnly', //delete        $Type             : 'Common.ValueListParameterOut', //delete        LocalDataProperty : 'locationWCDetail', ValueListProperty : '' },
{ $Type             : 'Common.ValueListParameterDisplayOnly', ValueListProperty : 'WorkCenterCategoryCode' }, { $Type             : 'Common.ValueListParameterOut', LocalDataProperty : 'MaintenancePlanningPlant', ValueListProperty : 'Plant' } ] }}); }
In addition, the Entitypath 'WorkCenterVH' must contain a text annotation for ValueListProperty : 'WorkCenter'

Hello ,
we did a deeper analysis of this issue together with our colleagues. As for now we see, that current versions will not solve this problem, but it looks like a correct configuration setting may solve your issue without a version change.
As the connection to the system is closed now, please reopen it for us for further analysis.

Remark: UI5 Version 1.105 should also solve this issue. 2022-09-14 14:06:58 -  (D039850) (External Info)
Hello ,
this is a known limitation of the old value help control which is replaced with UI5 1.104 and above. The behaviour is handled by another component, therefore I forward it.
As 1.98 is not supported by patches we would recommend an upgrade to UI5 1.105 if this is possible for you.
Regards 
2022-09-14 14:01:40 -  (D039850) (Internal Info)
Hello colleagues,
this is an app on UI5 1.98 and the old value help control. We identified that a selection on an identical key value did not trigger out parameter propagation.
May you please check from your side a proposed solution. Either a fix or an upgrade.
Thanks

Hi , You can access the application through the below mentioned url. Access is already provided to you. And the issue is completey based on UI, It does not have any link to the remote server. URL - https://-cf-provider-dev-hcl-mro-requestdolphin-ui.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/mro-requestdolphin-ui/webapp/
Steps for creating that issue -
Step 1 – Create a new request with all mandatory fields ->  Description, Business Partner, Request Type and Work Location. (In Work location I’m selecting the record as Work Location “-000” –  and Work Location Plant –“X001”).
Step 2 – Work Location plant will get auto filed once you select the Work Location.
Step 3 – Click on the Create button at bottom right corner, then the record will be created correctly with the correct data set of Work Location And Work Location Plant.
Step 4 – Click on EDIT button and change the Work Location through the value help and select the record (Work Location – “-000” and Work Location Plant – X002) And then click on OK button of value help of Work Location.
Step 5 – After clicking on OK, the Work location Plant is not changed to X002, that I have selected from the Value help. And after saving also the old Work Location Plant is only visible i.e., X001.

The issue is that the Work Location Plant should also get change once I’m changing the Work Location, means it is not fetching the complete contrast of that record I’m selecting.
Please check this and If you face any problems while generating this issue then you can get back to us. Thanks,  2022-09-08 08:22:44 -  (D039850) (External Info)

Hi , The issue is still there. You can test the issue with Work Location "-000", which has different Work Location Plant. Thanks,  2022-09-06 10:20:54 -  (D039850) (External Info)
Hello ,
we can access the app now but we only find one value help entry for Work Location AF.

AF

Airframe - Airframe

0003

For other cases we were not able to reproduce this issue, the Work Location Plant gets changed as expected.
Did you already corrected your configuration and does this issue still exists?

Hi colleagues,
this is a wrong configuaration of the used FieldValueHelp from FE side.
The Field is configured to show the description. But on the FieldValueHelp the descriptionPath is not set. So the description cannot be determined automatically by choosing a value in the dialog. Instead of this an  is used to bind the description to a model and bind this to the additionalValue of the Field. This leads to asynchronous updates of the Field. If the value or additionalValue is changed from outside the current  values are removed, as the Field thinks it it not chosen from the ValueHelp.
So please add the right DescriptionPath to the FieldValueHelp and remove the logic to fill the additionalValue via OutParameters. (This will just bring trouble with asynchronous updates.)
Kind regards,  2022-08-31 11:57:21 -  (I522135) (Internal Info)
Hi ,
Similar to other tickets, this seems somehow related to Field._updateCondition again: When an additionalValue is changing (but a given value stays the same), the outParameters on the previously available condition are lost. The field itself will then never trigger a change as the comparison in Operator.compareConditions only considers outParameters when both conditions contain such.
Let's look together into it, when you are back and have some time.

Best,

Dear ,
This customer has an issue with Value Help in their custom app. Please use -000 instead of AF.
When creating a Maintenance Request, we need to select a Work Location Value from the Value help. When we select the 1st row (as shown in screenshot 1) i.e. Work Location = AF and Plant = X001 and create a record, the record is saved correctly (as shown in screenshot 2). Now when we Edit the same Maintenance Request and open the Work Location Value Help, and this time select the 2nd row (as shown in screenshot 3) i.e. Work Location = AF and Plant = X003, the new select value of plant is not reflected. It still shows the old plant value i.e. X001. (as shown in screenshot 4) Steps for creating that issue:
Step 1 – Create a new request with all mandatory fields ->  Description, Business Partner, Request Type and Work Location. (In Work location I’m selecting the record as Work Location – AF and Work Location Plant –X001). (Step1 Screenshot)
Step 2 – Work Location plant will get auto filed once you select the Work Location. (Step2 Screenshot)
Step 3 – Click on the Create button at bottom right corner, then the record will be created correctly with the correct data set of Work Location And Work Location Plant. (Step3 Screenshot)
Step 4 – Click on EDIT button and change the Work Location through the value help and select the record (Work Location – AF and Work Location Plant – X003) And then click on OK button of value help of Work Location. (Step4 Screenshot)
Step 5 – After clicking on OK, the Work location Plant is not changed to X003, that I have selected from the Value help. (Step5 Screenshot).
The issue is that the Work Location Plant should also get change once I’m changing the Work Location, means it is not fetching the complete contrast of that record I’m selecting. CA-UI5-ST-LR devs do not believe this issue belongs to them and recommended forwarding this issue to you. Could you look into this please?

Hi Colleague,
I somehow see this app is not a FE smart template based application, and hence this issue will not be under our scope to debug through. Either ways it seems like they have an issue with the value help calls so if they still want to proceed the CA-UI5-CMP could have a look at it.
Irrespective of which I still feel its not under our scope as it seems like a custom based application. Could you kindly communicate the same to the customer.

Hi , Apologies for long response time. As there is some changes in data set that's why there is no different plant available for the Work Location 'AF'. Please check this issue by using Work Location '-000'. This work location has two different plant 'X001' and 'X002'.

Hi , Please see the newly attached image "work_location". As you can see, I can only see the X003 plant for the AF work location. I cannot see X001. I cannot fully reproduce the issue due to this.

Hi ,

I have created a new record you can test the issue on this record. Or you can test this issue by creating a new record by using the work Location mentioned below.

Steps for creating that issue:
Step 1 – Create a new request with all mandatory fields ->  Description, Business Partner, Request Type and Work Location. (In Work location I’m selecting the record as Work Location – AF and Work Location Plant –X001). (Step1 Screenshot)
Step 2 – Work Location plant will get auto filed once you select the Work Location. (Step2 Screenshot)
Step 3 – Click on the Create button at bottom right corner, then the record will be created correctly with the correct data set of Work Location And Work Location Plant. (Step3 Screenshot)
Step 4 – Click on EDIT button and change the Work Location through the value help and select the record (Work Location – AF and Work Location Plant – X003) And then click on OK button of value help of Work Location. (Step4 Screenshot)
Step 5 – After clicking on OK, the Work location Plant is not changed to X003, that I have selected from the Value help. (Step5 Screenshot).

The issue is that the Work Location Plant should also get change once I’m changing the Work Location, means it is not fetching the complete contrast of that record I’m selecting. Regards,  2022-07-14 14:54:42 -  (I560294) (External Info)

Hi , Apologies for the long response time. Could you open your R/3 and HTTP connections so that I can reproduce and investigate the issue. Please maintain a user in the secure logon area which I can use to logon to reproduce. Also could you provide a HTTP network trace log in your browser's developer tools. You can do this by following this knowledge base article: 2505725 - How to create HTTP trace in Fiori Launchpad using Google Chrome, Edge,  or Internet Explorer 2022-06-27 12:56:06 -  (I560294) (Internal Info)

Hi Colleagues,

Customer has some issue with value helper, it is not updated properly, the previous value is displayed:
"
When creating a Maintenance Request, we need to select a Work Location Value from the Value help. When we select the 1st row (as shown in screenshot 1) i.e. Work Location = AF and Plant = X001 and create a record, the record is saved correctly (as shown in screenshot 2).
Now when we Edit the same Maintenance Request and open the Work Location Value Help, and this time select the 2nd row (as shown in screenshot 3) i.e. Work Location = AF and Plant = X003, the new select value of plant is not reflected. It still shows the old plant value i.e. X001. (as shown in screenshot 4)
"

Could you help further, it is related to the UI, not to CAP itself.

Best regards,

Hi,

I’m using Nodejs runtime to develop the cap application. Also, I have Attached the http trace for the value help issue.

And I can’t share you the reference project because it’s a customer project but If you need we can have a debugging session according to your convenient time. I’m based on India time zone. Regards,  2022-06-20 07:45:45 -  (I044540) (External Info)
Hi ,

Could you attach a sample project to replicate the issue and capture an HTTP trace about the preformed steps, see SAP Note
1990706 How to capture an HTTP trace using Google Chrome or MS Edge (Chromium)
Does the application use Nodejs or Java runtime?
For the issue 2 please start a new incident, refer to SAP Note   50048 - Several queries in one incident
